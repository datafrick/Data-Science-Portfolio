    "### Pothole Detection and Localization using Deep Learning (CNN)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background**\n",
    "The nature of the road surface a vehicle plies can have a huge impact on its wear and tear rate. It’s one of the major determinants in estimating the frequency of maintenance required to keep a vehicle in good condition. Human drivers are quite good at spotting these road irregularities and manoeuvring manned vehicles to avoid them. What if we train a machine to be able to do the same? It will sure be a worthwhile.<br> \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "**Solution** <br>\n",
    "In this project, I have built a binary classifier capable of detecting the presence of potholes and irregulaties on a road surface using Convolution Neural Network (CNN). I will be including localization as a regression model later on to create bounding boxes around the pothole locations.\n",
