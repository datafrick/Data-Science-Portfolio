## Pothole Detection and Localization using Deep Learning (CNN)

**Background**

- The nature of the road surface a vehicle plies can have a huge impact on its wear and tear rate. It’s one of the major determinants in estimating the frequency of maintenance required to keep a vehicle in good condition. Human drivers are quite good at spotting these road irregularities and manoeuvring manned vehicles to avoid them. What if we train a machine to be able to do the same? It will sure be a worthwhile. 

**Solution** 

- In this project, I have built a binary classifier capable of detecting the presence of potholes and irregulaties on a road surface using Convolution Neural Network (CNN). I will be including localization as a regression model later on to create bounding boxes around the pothole locations. 

**Areas of commercial application**

•	Insurance – to aid objective vehicle insurance premium calculation
•	Road network maintenance - government agencies 
•	Autonomous vehicle vision
