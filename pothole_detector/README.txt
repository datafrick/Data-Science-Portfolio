Pothole Detection and Localization using Deep Learning (CNN)

Background
The nature of the road surface a vehicle plies can have a huge impact on its wear and tear rate. It’s one of the major determinants in estimating the frequency of maintenance required to keep a vehicle in good condition. Human drivers are quite good at spotting these road irregularities and manoeuvring manned vehicles to avoid them. What if we train a machine to be able to do the same? It will sure be a worthwhile. 

Proposed solution
In this project I will build a multinomial classifier that will be able to detect, give the sizes as well as localize potholes on a road surface. I’m proposing to use the Artificial Neural network Technique. 

Project goals and milestones:
The end goal of the project is to create a model that will be able to detect and localize potholes. The first milestone is create a binary classifier. If that is successful, next I will create a regression model for predicting the upper left and lower right coordinates of bounding boxes around the pothole.

Areas of commercial application
•	Insurance – to aid objective vehicle insurance premium calculation
•	Road network maintenance - government agencies 
•	Autonomous vehicle  vision

Data source
The dataset I’m proposing to use was sourced from an academic research paper in which the author employed colour segmentation to identify road irregularities on road surfaces. That data was made available to the public through a shared google drive folder. 

Data Access: 
I have cloned a copy of the data folder in my google drive from which the model will access the images as well as the annotation files.
