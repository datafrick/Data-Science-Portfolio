## Topic Modelling and Document Indexing (NLP) 

In this project, I scraped over 100k posts from an immigration focused social media forum and created a 10 topic NLP model off the interactions. The topics cut across visa eligibility, documentation, language tests, finance among others. This ensured quick navigation and ease of obtaining specific information from the 6year old forum.
