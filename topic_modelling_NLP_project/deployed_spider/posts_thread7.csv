It was a terrible experience. I came to the exam hall by 8.45am only to meet a closed exam hall. We were abt 25 candidates who came late. The examiner asked us to go, after much pleading we were allowed to enter the hall,but our listening was conducted separate. I didn't do well at all cos of I was tensed.<br><br>Then in 2016 I started again with 2nd ielts ( LRWS 7.5,6.5,7.5,<img src=""https://www.nairaland.com/faces/cool.png"" alt=""cool"" border=""0"" class=""faces"">, document evaluation, online classes for licensing exams and exam registration.

Then my brother in-law paid for my 7th attempt to encourage me. I read my ass out, hired a tutor to Mark my essay wrote over 50 essays as I figured out that writing was my problem. I even did group reading with an old friend who was also writing ielts to make sure I pass( u know that feeling when someone is paying you don't want to fail). I also tripled my prayers.<br> 7th attempt August 18th LRWS 9,8,6.5,7.5 <br>At this point I didn't cry neither was I depressed I decided to quit, perhaps Canada is not for me. My friend talked said one word that struck me "" I don't know abt you but am not quitting "" . then I decided to do it one last time. She also told me abt mod ielts I decided to give it a trial as its been BC all along. My brother in-law paid for my ielts again, then I booked the exam. I had only a week to prepare.

"<div class=""narrow"">Chai! I missed page 1? My PPR will be in this part 7. Meanwhile, posting this for my friend...<br><br><br><br><br>I want to share my story to encourage someone <br>The taught about relocation to Canada was initiated in early  2015 by my Hubby's friend who had just relocated to Canada. At first I refuted the idea cos I just started a new business and my master's degree program. I imaged dropping them just like that. However, after must pressure and explanation from hubby I gave in, then the journey started.<br>I decided to follow it through two strategies: firstly to write my licencing exams from naija and get a job n migrate, secondly, to  go through express entry.<br><br>In December 2015, I wrote my first ielts. It was a terrible experience. I came to the exam hall by 8.45am only to meet a closed exam hall. We were abt 25 candidates who came late. The examiner asked us to go, after much pleading we were allowed to enter the hall,but our listening was conducted separate. I didn't do well at all cos of I was tensed.<br><br>Then in 2016 I started again with 2nd ielts ( LRWS 7.5,6.5,7.5,<img src=""https://www.nairaland.com/faces/cool.png"" alt=""cool"" border=""0"" class=""faces"">, document evaluation, online classes for licensing exams and exam registration. I then applied for Canada visa to go n write the exam but was rejected twice n I missed the exam. I was depressed. At that point we decided to quit the process n focus in naija.<br><br>However, in 2017 we decided to just enter the pool.<br>Our crs  score was 395, I decided to leave it like that and continue my life hoping that one day the score will drop.<br><br>In Jan 2018, my Hubby's colleague told him that his is relocating to Canada with his family next month.<br>That news made my hubby to start having a rethink abt continuing but I convinced him otherwise n told him that we should remain focused on our new year resolution, so he agreed.<br>Then 2 weeks later a customer told me she was relocating to Canada too in May. This news woke me up from my slumber. Then we decided to start all over. At this point I surfed the net to find out ways to improve my scores. My hubby did ielts n document evaluation. <br>My ielts journey began again in 2018<br>3rd ielts attempt march 24 LRWS 6.5,7,6.5,7<br>4th attempt May 24 LRWS 7,7,7,7<br>Then I took I month leave to study,  I read every every, full of confidence. I booked two exams one week apart. Hoping that one must be good as I was determined to enter Canada by all means<br>5th attempt June 30th LRWS 8,7,6,7<br>6th attempt July 7th LRWS 8.5,7,6.5,7<br>I wept bitterly at this point, hw  with encouragement from family n friends I was more determined.

My wife and I (both lawyers) did our ECA with WES.  My ECA came out a few days before we wrote IELTS.  Once the IELTS result was released, without my spouse’s ECA, we had a CRS of 442.  The cut off for April 25, 2018 was 441 and we received our first ITA.  Fast-forward to June, 2018, I stumbled upon this thread on Nairaland at about past 1a.m. (cannot remember what kept me awake till that time) and on page 1, I saw the advise that lawyers should use IQAS and not WES.  Engaged members on thread and there was a consensus that it is always better to err on the side of caution.  Rejected the first ITA on this basis and for other reasons.  Registered for IQAS and commenced the long wait for the ECA from IQAS which took three months.<br><br><b>Medicals</b><br>We knew my spouse had a history of TB from about 21 years back and we declared that in our PR application.  Hence, a few days after we had our upfront medicals, we received a mail from IRCC asking for further medical examination for myself (my BP was slightly high on the day of the medicals) and my spouse.  Mine was quite straight forward.  But we had to wait about three months for the results of my spouse’s sputum test to be ready and then a repeat x-ray.<br><br><b>POF</b><br>POF was deposited in mutual funds which I opened sometime in April 2018.  The entire POF sum consisted of Esusu money (disclosed as such to IRCC with evidence of establishment of Esusu in my office (E-mail thread)), sale of my wife’s car, sale of a land, gift deed from brother-in-law and my father.  We put all this information in a tabular format and provided 8 months statement of account highlighting inflows and outflows to the mutual funds account.  POF was also supported with 25% of the balance in my RSA.<br><br><b>PPR</b><br>Repeat X-ray for my spouse was carried out on January 18, 2019 at the Consultant Practice. I remember that from January 18, 2019 and for about 7 days thereafter Ottawa was raining PPRs.  I was prayerfully expecting ours too.  However, on January 22, 2019, we received an ADR letter dated January 21, 2019 in our MyCIC inbox (addressed to me) stating there were some outstanding medicals and that I should contact the Panel Physician. We were given 30 days to provide evidence that we had completed all medical examinations.  I rushed to the Consultant Practice and obtained another upfront medical sheet for myself indicating that all medical exams have been completed. However, I was informed that my wife’s repeat x-ray results had not been uploaded and I was told to call on January 24, 2019 for an update.  On January 24, 2019, my spouse and I went to the Consultant Practice.  The same story.  Result not yet updated but this time the excuse was that the Panel Physician was not in the country and, as such, the results cannot be uploaded because she had a role to play in getting that done.  In fact, I was informed that a message has been sent to her and that she was not responding to her messages.  I remember I got back to the office and a colleague of mine who had already landed asked me to put the Panel Physician’s matter in prayer.  I thought to myself that why waste my prayers when I know that God has perfected it all. In fact, the spirit kept nagging me that the ADR letter was supposed to be PPR letter and that the Consultant Practice was just the hindrance.  I cannot remember what I was searching for in my Yahoo inbox.  But I stumbled on a mail I had written to the Consultant Practice to book an appointment for the upfront medicals in October, 2018.  Something nudged me immediately to do a mail to the Consultant Practice. I was just hoping someone high up there will see my mail.  I poured my anger into that e-mail, I must confess.  Lo and behold, the Panel Physician responded to my e-mail within an hour and promised that the results will be uploaded.<br><br>I travelled to Abuja for work the next day on January 25, 2019. So I was in Abuja when my spouse called to tell me that the results had been uploaded as promised.  She decided to wait for my return before uploading the updated Upfront Medical Form she obtained from the hospital.  My return to Lagos was a miracle.  A colleague in the office who was supposed to book my return ticket to Lagos actually booked “Lagos-Abuja” as my return ticket.  It was not funny.  By the time I found out, it was not possible to get on another plane that was leaving for Lagos early enough.  I got a flight for 7.30pm.  By the time I got to the airport, I met some of my colleagues who had departed for the airport since before Noon still waiting for their delayed flight.  I told myself, I will get to Lagos today.  Once again, my God of Hands of Fire showed up.  My flight (the last flight or so) was called on time and I left my colleagues (whose flight was supposed to have been earlier) there in the airport.<br><br>Got to Lagos and hurriedly got to scanning and uploading the documents. The moment we opened our MyCIC account, we saw MEDICAL PASSED. My wife collapsed in relief.  MIRACLE ONE, IT WAS AS IF THE VO WAS WAITING FOR THE HOSPITAL TO UPLOAD THE RESULTS.  We sha uploaded the ADR even at that point ADR has become moot.  This was still January 25, 2019. I remember telling my spouse that I expect PPR by February 5, 2019.  She disagreed with me saying it will land on February 2, 2019. Of course, I totally disagreed because she had this penchant of wanting every important event to happen on her birthday-February 2.  Finally, she prophesied (without knowing), she jokingly said “God will shame both of us and bring 2 and 5 together and give us PPR today January 25, 2019”.<br><br>Hence, I woke up at past 3am. Checked my e-mail.  Nothing. I was sad but kept faith with February 5, 2019 on the horizon. I was sad because my spirit kept telling that the VO working on our file was just waiting for us to act so that he can finish his work. In fact, a witness in one of my cases (who I happen to have met at the Consultant Practice when we went for the upfront medical) had told me that much also just a day before. In any event, I went back to bed.  Few minutes after, my wife wakes me up shouting “VFS!!! Check our CIC account!”.  My people, it was Pret Pour Visa!!!<br><br>My people, we went from no MEP at over three months post-AOR to MEP and PPR on the same day!!!  I know that the grace and mercy that found us, will find everyone too.  All of our journeys will be different. But we will all get there!!! Keep the hope and faith alive always.<br></blockquote><br>Congratulations to your family! We shall join you soonest to in Jesus Christ name. Amen!</div>",4:11pm,Feb-19,2019

The cut off for April 25, 2018 was 441 and we received our first ITA.  Fast-forward to June, 2018, I stumbled upon this thread on Nairaland at about past 1a.m. (cannot remember what kept me awake till that time) and on page 1, I saw the advise that lawyers should use IQAS and not WES.  Engaged members on thread and there was a consensus that it is always better to err on the side of caution.  Rejected the first ITA on this basis and for other reasons.  Registered for IQAS and commenced the long wait for the ECA from IQAS which took three months.<br><br><b>Medicals</b><br>We knew my spouse had a history of TB from about 21 years back and we declared that in our PR application.  Hence, a few days after we had our upfront medicals, we received a mail from IRCC asking for further medical examination for myself (my BP was slightly high on the day of the medicals) and my spouse.  Mine was quite straight forward.  But we had to wait about three months for the results of my spouse’s sputum test to be ready and then a repeat x-ray.<br><br><b>POF</b><br>POF was deposited in mutual funds which I opened sometime in April 2018.  The entire POF sum consisted of Esusu money (disclosed as such to IRCC with evidence of establishment of Esusu in my office (E-mail thread)), sale of my wife’s car, sale of a land, gift deed from brother-in-law and my father.  We put all this information in a tabular format and provided 8 months statement of account highlighting inflows and outflows to the mutual funds account.  POF was also supported with 25% of the balance in my RSA.<br><br><b>PPR</b><br>Repeat X-ray for my spouse was carried out on January 18, 2019 at the Consultant Practice. I remember that from January 18, 2019 and for about 7 days thereafter Ottawa was raining PPRs.  I was prayerfully expecting ours too.  However, on January 22, 2019, we received an ADR letter dated January 21, 2019 in our MyCIC inbox (addressed to me) stating there were some outstanding medicals and that I should contact the Panel Physician. We were given 30 days to provide evidence that we had completed all medical examinations.  I rushed to the Consultant Practice and obtained another upfront medical sheet for myself indicating that all medical exams have been completed. However, I was informed that my wife’s repeat x-ray results had not been uploaded and I was told to call on January 24, 2019 for an update.  On January 24, 2019, my spouse and I went to the Consultant Practice.  The same story.  Result not yet updated but this time the excuse was that the Panel Physician was not in the country and, as such, the results cannot be uploaded because she had a role to play in getting that done.  In fact, I was informed that a message has been sent to her and that she was not responding to her messages.  I remember I got back to the office and a colleague of mine who had already landed asked me to put the Panel Physician’s matter in prayer.  I thought to myself that why waste my prayers when I know that God has perfected it all. In fact, the spirit kept nagging me that the ADR letter was supposed to be PPR letter and that the Consultant Practice was just the hindrance.  I cannot remember what I was searching for in my Yahoo inbox.  But I stumbled on a mail I had written to the Consultant Practice to book an appointment for the upfront medicals in October, 2018.  Something nudged me immediately to do a mail to the Consultant Practice. I was just hoping someone high up there will see my mail.  I poured my anger into that e-mail, I must confess.  Lo and behold, the Panel Physician responded to my e-mail within an hour and promised that the results will be uploaded.<br><br>I travelled to Abuja for work the next day on January 25, 2019. So I was in Abuja when my spouse called to tell me that the results had been uploaded as promised.  She decided to wait for my return before uploading the updated Upfront Medical Form she obtained from the hospital.  My return to Lagos was a miracle.  A colleague in the office who was supposed to book my return ticket to Lagos actually booked “Lagos-Abuja” as my return ticket.  It was not funny.  By the time I found out, it was not possible to get on another plane that was leaving for Lagos early enough.  I got a flight for 7.30pm.  By the time I got to the airport, I met some of my colleagues who had departed for the airport since before Noon still waiting for their delayed flight.  I told myself, I will get to Lagos today.  Once again, my God of Hands of Fire showed up.  My flight (the last flight or so) was called on time and I left my colleagues (whose flight was supposed to have been earlier) there in the airport.<br><br>Got to Lagos and hurriedly got to scanning and uploading the documents. The moment we opened our MyCIC account, we saw MEDICAL PASSED. My wife collapsed in relief.  MIRACLE ONE, IT WAS AS IF THE VO WAS WAITING FOR THE HOSPITAL TO UPLOAD THE RESULTS.  We sha uploaded the ADR even at that point ADR has become moot.  This was still January 25, 2019. I remember telling my spouse that I expect PPR by February 5, 2019.  She disagreed with me saying it will land on February 2, 2019. Of course, I totally disagreed because she had this penchant of wanting every important event to happen on her birthday-February 2.  Finally, she prophesied (without knowing), she jokingly said “God will shame both of us and bring 2 and 5 together and give us PPR today January 25, 2019”.<br><br>Hence, I woke up at past 3am. Checked my e-mail.  Nothing. I was sad but kept faith with February 5, 2019 on the horizon. I was sad because my spirit kept telling that the VO working on our file was just waiting for us to act so that he can finish his work. In fact, a witness in one of my cases (who I happen to have met at the Consultant Practice when we went for the upfront medical) had told me that much also just a day before. In any event, I went back to bed.  Few minutes after, my wife wakes me up shouting “VFS!!! Check our CIC account!”.  My people, it was Pret Pour Visa!!!<br><br>My people, we went from no MEP at over three months post-AOR to MEP and PPR on the same day!!!  I know that the grace and mercy that found us, will find everyone too.  All of our journeys will be different. But we will all get there!!! Keep the hope and faith alive always.</div>",2:11pm,Feb-19,2019

"<div class=""narrow"">I'm sorry this is coming late.<br>I started the journey around June 2018. I am a silent reader and was inspired by the success stories I read here. And so I decided to give it a try. ECA was with WES and straightforward. <br>IELTS was on July 7. Initially had LRWS 8 8.5 6.5 8 but EOR was successful and writing upgraded to 7. I noticed the score change in the morning of August 8. I started following up with IDP Australia a week after I submitted the EOR on July 20 and always checked online early in the morning and just before I sleep at night. Called IDP that Wednesday morning (there was going to be a draw that day) to find out if they had the hard copy same day and went to their office at Ogudu to pick up. They had the hard copy but hadn't mailed me to pick it up yet as the bank draft for refund of the EOR fee wasn't ready yet. I told them I didn't mind and could pick up the draft later. <br>I got the ITA same day. <br>Submitted the application on Sept 1 and notified them of my intention to add common-law partner on November 7. We were given 30 days to submit the additional documents. Submitted on December 7.<br>I received a mail requesting her to do Biometrics and a few minutes later, the PPR mail came on February 12.<br>Documents submitted include<br>AXA Money Market as POF<br>Bank Account letter of confirmation and proof of investment in Fixed deposit.<br>Letter from a Close Friend attesting to the relationship<br>AXA life insurance policy naming her as beneficiary.<br>Rent receipt in both our names for one year.<br>Statement of account showing transfers from my account to hers over the past one year<br>Photographs taken together with time date of location spanning one year (10 photos).<br>I wish everyone speedy processing and success.</div>",7:12am,Feb-20,2019

"<div class=""narrow"">Sorry to hear about ICES wahala, those people are just taking the piss now  Here's what I'd advise you to do asap.<br><br>Get in touch with your school and have your transcript sent asap via courier to ICES. Make sure you collect tracking number.<br>As soon as you see that it has arrived at ICES office, send them an email saying that you are disappointed with their service, your ECA application is already over 10 weeks and they didn't tell you that there was any issue. Also tell them that another copy of your transcript have been delivered to them and that you would like your application completed as soon as possible. Ask them to confirm that they have received it.<br>From my experience, I used DHL to send the transcript again to ICES, took one week to arrive in Canada and the ECA was delivered to me via UPS a month later. So in total, it was additional 5 weeks that ICES took before they completed the application. <br>Hope this helps <br><blockquote><a href=""/post/75911556""><b>Chicagomum</b></a>:<br>Hello All, <br><br>Please help o.

"<div class=""narrow"">The registration and exam cost is 297 pounds. You don't need to pay for their materials and study cost.

First IELTS was LRWS: 7.5, 7.5, 8.0, 8.5...I was so excited thinking that was gonna fetch me a good CRS not knowing i needed atleast an 8.0 in the listening band. I really appreciate the great guys here who encouraged me to retake the test. Got back to Nigeria in January 2018 and decided to retake IELTS, this time around in March. Had ample time to prepare and was very much relaxed in the hall. My second IELTS test was LRWS: 8.0, 7.0, 7.5, 7.5 which was enough for me. As for the materials i used, i basically used online platforms like ieltliz, ieltsbuddy.com and ielts-up.com.<br><br><b>ECA</b><br>This was straightforward as i evaluated just my Masters degree.

I so disturbed these guys and trust me, they were of great help. <br><br><b>EMPLOYMENT:</b><br>This was the point i needed my God to step into the matter...lolzzzz.. I actually worked in a firm where i was paid in cash, and all i did was to get a reference letter from my boss in CIC format. I also included an LOE stating the reason i was paid in cash. It was indicated on the letter that i was paid in cash. As for online presence, the firm had no online presence like a website, and i had to including a screenshot of the firm's registration page on the CAC's website. Lastly, i included my boss's complimentary card just incase they decide to reach him directly. In all, i committed everything to God. One prayer i kept praying was, God please blind them from all my inadequacies and trust me this prayer worked like magic..hahahahha.<br><br><b>PCC: </b><br>I applied for Nigeria and UK PCC. Mr Moshood was of great help when i applied for the Nigeria PCC. Though he made some errors on my PCC, but Lucia was very helpful as she helped me apply for another and scanned it to me. <br><br><b>ADRs</b>:<br>I recieved my first ADR on Sept 20th and it was to fill Schedule A form, of which i did immediately and submitted.<br>Second ADR came in October, which was to make payment for RPRF. Made this payment immediately.<br>Third ADR came in and lo and behold, i thought it was PPR not knowing i had another form to fill up. This time around, it had to do with filling the IMM5406 form (additional family information). As usual, i responded swiftly.<br><br><b>GCMS NOTES:  </b><br>Ordered first set of gcms notes on the 24th of November, 2018, and for over 60days it wasn't delivered. Mailed them severally and kept getting all sort of excuses. Atlast,  had to re-order and it arrived on the 9th of Feb, 2019. Everything look cool. The wait continued<br><br>In all these, it's been a long wait...some will say long overdue but i must say it is worth the wait. At some point i almost lost it 'cos i was beginning to get fed up with responses from CIC agents. Disturbing CIC agents became a hobby to me, as i kept calling and calling...dats how i spoke to one agent thrice on different occassions..lolz...but shun, this lady's voice is something else...often felt at home each time i got connected to her. Will miss her though...hope we get to meet in Cannyland. Psychologically, this process drained me..imagine friends always wanting to know wats going on in this life of dis dude who just got back from UK...enemies at the gate i must say...but God pass them. I no wan mention all dos ""cats"" (babes) wey don chop my UK money run....lolzzz.. dey go soon come back to chop Canny money...Chop keee una there...hahahahaha... <br><br>Emotionally, it was hard for me...thinking about the whole process and thinking about a sick dad who keeps asking...""my son, when are they gonna send the mail?...are you sure this thing will work out?...it became a regular thing that each time i watched his face and have the thoughts of FSW Express Entry, i simply got weak. One thing is for sure, he gave me a big smile early this morning when i got the golden mail..been a while i saw him smile though. One thing is for sure, i am happy he is strong to see this become a reality....no worry, na canny doctors go treat u las las.

I have a few questions, and I hope someone has answers.<br><br>I checked the total costs I would need to spend and I arrived at approximately GBP 300. However, adding study costs, brings an additional GBP 900 to the cost. So I want to know if it is compulsory to get their study materials and register at their tutor centres. Or can I just register for the exams and get good study materials for free online?<br><br>Finally and most importantly, can you (and others here) please confirm if WES and ICES actually assess a bachelors degree and CIMA's ""Certificate in Business Accounting"" as 2 or more certificates? There's another professional diploma from CIMA that gets assessed as 3 years bachelors degree, but I haven't seen any info online on how ECA guys assess this their certificate program.<br><br>I hope to get better info from all the ogas here.

I contemplated including one, but when i got necessary advice from the likes of Tojued and Newmum0615, i had to submit my application without including payslips. Happytbaby, glitteringstar, ugoiyke79e, thanks for all your mails. I so disturbed these guys and trust me, they were of great help. <br><br><b>EMPLOYMENT:</b><br>This was the point i needed my God to step into the matter...lolzzzz.. I actually worked in a firm where i was paid in cash, and all i did was to get a reference letter from my boss in CIC format. I also included an LOE stating the reason i was paid in cash. It was indicated on the letter that i was paid in cash. As for online presence, the firm had no online presence like a website, and i had to including a screenshot of the firm's registration page on the CAC's website. Lastly, i included my boss's complimentary card just incase they decide to reach him directly. In all, i committed everything to God. One prayer i kept praying was, God please blind them from all my inadequacies and trust me this prayer worked like magic..hahahahha.<br><br><b>PCC: </b><br>I applied for Nigeria and UK PCC. Mr Moshood was of great help when i applied for the Nigeria PCC. Though he made some errors on my PCC, but Lucia was very helpful as she helped me apply for another and scanned it to me. <br><br><b>ADRs</b>:<br>I recieved my first ADR on Sept 20th and it was to fill Schedule A form, of which i did immediately and submitted.<br>Second ADR came in October, which was to make payment for RPRF. Made this payment immediately.<br>Third ADR came in and lo and behold, i thought it was PPR not knowing i had another form to fill up. This time around, it had to do with filling the IMM5406 form (additional family information). As usual, i responded swiftly.<br><br><b>GCMS NOTES:  </b><br>Ordered first set of gcms notes on the 24th of November, 2018, and for over 60days it wasn't delivered. Mailed them severally and kept getting all sort of excuses. Atlast,  had to re-order and it arrived on the 9th of Feb, 2019. Everything look cool. The wait continued<br><br>In all these, it's been a long wait...some will say long overdue but i must say it is worth the wait. At some point i almost lost it 'cos i was beginning to get fed up with responses from CIC agents. Disturbing CIC agents became a hobby to me, as i kept calling and calling...dats how i spoke to one agent thrice on different occassions..lolz...but shun, this lady's voice is something else...often felt at home each time i got connected to her. Will miss her though...hope we get to meet in Cannyland. Psychologically, this process drained me..imagine friends always wanting to know wats going on in this life of dis dude who just got back from UK...enemies at the gate i must say...but God pass them. I no wan mention all dos ""cats"" (babes) wey don chop my UK money run....lolzzz.. dey go soon come back to chop Canny money...Chop keee una there...hahahahaha... <br><br>Emotionally, it was hard for me...thinking about the whole process and thinking about a sick dad who keeps asking...""my son, when are they gonna send the mail?...are you sure this thing will work out?...it became a regular thing that each time i watched his face and have the thoughts of FSW Express Entry, i simply got weak. One thing is for sure, he gave me a big smile early this morning when i got the golden mail..been a while i saw him smile though. One thing is for sure, i am happy he is strong to see this become a reality....no worry, na canny doctors go treat u las las. Maybe all those great doctors on this thread.<br><br>I must say a huge thank you to everyone who chipped in one info or the other, you guys were of great help. Smslive, indeed you are a great oracle. Fresty, we global now !!!! Cheee !!!  thanks for being a buddy indeed...God bless you real good.<br><br>To my family...u know yourselves, AOR August Whatsapp group and August ITA whatsapp group, you guys rock.. Love y'all.. Mo, u aiit? init? <br><br>To the newbies or those in the process, stay strong, stay focused, asked questions, i repeat ask questions.. read...read...read too...this journey is one that requires even the smallest person beside u.. Throw away pride and ego, and be humble enough to seek information. It is key. <b>ABOVE ALL, BE CLOSE TO YOUR GOD...IT MIGHT SOUND FUNNY, BUT TRUST ME NOT EVERYONE WHO SEES YOU GOING TRU DIS PROCESS WISH U WELL...HENCE, BE CLOSE TO YOUR GOD.</b><br><br><b>TIMELINE:</b><br><br>One funny thing that happened prior to when i got the ghost update yesterday morning was that, i ordered for second GCMS notes in the morning, and after some minutes i got the ghost update, trust igbo guy like me naa.. i hurriedly mailed gcmsbuddy to cancel my order and initiate a refund.

"<div class=""narrow"">This should be helpful to post-AOR folks.....<br><br>IRCC has introduced a number of changes in recent months and it is time to update our understanding of the post-AOR stages. This is simply built on the amazing work of an individual who developed an explanation of the various stages we can use - informally - to track the progress of our application. Other expert individuals have posited the underlying trends and found evidence for them. <b>In short, the traditional transition from IP1 to IP2 to ghost update to PPR still holds but in a modified way due to these changes.</b><br><br><b>From 31st December 2018</b>, everyone except for Inland candidates has to provide their biometrics which means the default starting stage applicants will see for their Background Check is ‘IP2’ (“We are processing your background check…”), however, this is a<span style=""color:#990000;""><b> ‘False IP2’</b></span>, meaning an IP2 that has appeared before it is actually due as the application has not in fact progressed to the IP2 stage yet.<br><br><b>If you have an AOR of 31st December 2018 or later,</b> follow the chart below to track your progress. <b>Candidates will remain in a state of <span style=""color:#990000;"">'False IP2'</span> throughout their application and only see a series of 'ghost updates' following their MEP;</b> the first such ghost update (which should follow shortly after MEP) will signify your Real IP1, the second ghost update will signify your Real IP2, and the third will be your ‘Final’ Ghost Update, following which you are likely to receive your PPR.<br><br><b>If you have an AOR date of up to 30 Dec 2018,</b> the chart also applies to you if you meet one or more of these conditions: you are a CEC or PNP-Inland candidate, you were required to provide your biometrics or you did not pay your RPRF upfront.<br><br><b>Note for FSW-Outland candidates who have an AOR date of up to 30 Dec 2018:</b> If you did not need to provide biometrics and paid your RPRF upfront, the old transition from NA1 all the way to a Final Ghost Update will still apply to you.

Background Check shows ""We are processing your background check. We will send you a message if we need more information.”<br><b>MEP</b> - Medicals passed: review of medical results changes from ""You do not need a medical exam."" to ""You have passed the medical exam."" There might be no email for MEP.<br><b>Ghost Update</b> - When you log in, the application says it's been ""updated"" but none of the fields have changed. Once you logout and log back in, the application returns to being ""submitted"". Ghost updates are not announced by email and a candidate must check their profile daily to not miss them.<br><b>Ghost Update #1 or <span style=""color:#990000;"">Real IP1</span></b> - ""In progress"" 1: Background Check changes to ""Your application is in progress. We will send you a message when we start your background check."" Usually follows MEP. Some applicants (especially Inland and CEC) skip this stage. You should receive an email for your Real IP1 - the email will not provide any details, just that your application has been updated.<br><b>NA2 </b>- ""Not Applicable"" 2: Background Check changes to ""Not Applicable"" again after IP1. Some applicants skip this stage and it is easily missed. No email.<br><b>Ghost Update #2 or <span style=""color:#990000;"">Real IP2 </span></b>- ""In progress"" 2: Background Check changes to ""We are processing your background check.

May your journey be smooth...<br><br><br><blockquote><a href=""/post/75926654""><b>fizzile</b></a>:<br><b>Decision to migrate:</b> <br>November 2017: At this point, it dawned on me that my stay in the UK was coming to an end. I possibly couldn't believe my eyes until i got a mail from Home Office reminding me that i had some months left on my Visa. I was like na so this people wan thank me for spending millions running a Masters programme? At this point, i pinched myself and i was like...""oboy wetin u wan go do for naija""? To start from the scratch? Mbanu !!! I thought of applying for scholarships in the UK and US but for the UK, i was like never!!!.. not after breaking my back all in d name of warehouse jobs...lolzz omor i huzzle shaaa oooo. Options like residency in Australia and Canada became my best bets but I rather chose the Canada route and came across this thread..the rest is history.<br><br><b>IELTS:</b>  <br>My first IELTS test was in the UK, and i prepared for two weeks. First IELTS was LRWS: 7.5, 7.5, 8.0, 8.5...I was so excited thinking that was gonna fetch me a good CRS not knowing i needed atleast an 8.0 in the listening band. I really appreciate the great guys here who encouraged me to retake the test. Got back to Nigeria in January 2018 and decided to retake IELTS, this time around in March. Had ample time to prepare and was very much relaxed in the hall. My second IELTS test was LRWS: 8.0, 7.0, 7.5, 7.5 which was enough for me. As for the materials i used, i basically used online platforms like ieltliz, ieltsbuddy.com and ielts-up.com.<br><br><b>ECA</b><br>This was straightforward as i evaluated just my Masters degree. WES was at my service and did the needful. Being a foreign degree, it was a smooth process for me, and i had my evaluation done within a month or thereabout.<br><b><br>MEDICALS</b><br>This was quite straightforward. Had mine at Prime Medicals in Port Harcourt. Unfortunately, they are no longer part of the process.<br><br><b>PROOF OF FUNDS(POF)</b><br>Used 100% gift deed from my dad. This was transferred to my savings account and transfer document for that was secured. Many have been of the opinion that notarizing the gift deed isn't necessary. Personally i notarized mine. For the gift deed, i simply followed the format put up by wakanowdotcom. His post was really helpful. Other documents i submitted are: <br>&gt;6-month bank statement showing inflow of cash and transfer of POF. <br>&gt;Also got a printout of currency converter (oanda and xe.com) as at day of submission, <br>&gt;LOE explaining source of funds and bulk sum and,<br>&gt; bank reference letter.<br>NO PAYSLIPS WAS INCLUDED. I contemplated including one, but when i got necessary advice from the likes of Tojued and Newmum0615, i had to submit my application without including payslips. Happytbaby, glitteringstar, ugoiyke79e, thanks for all your mails. I so disturbed these guys and trust me, they were of great help. <br><br><b>EMPLOYMENT:</b><br>This was the point i needed my God to step into the matter...lolzzzz.. I actually worked in a firm where i was paid in cash, and all i did was to get a reference letter from my boss in CIC format. I also included an LOE stating the reason i was paid in cash. It was indicated on the letter that i was paid in cash. As for online presence, the firm had no online presence like a website, and i had to including a screenshot of the firm's registration page on the CAC's website. Lastly, i included my boss's complimentary card just incase they decide to reach him directly. In all, i committed everything to God. One prayer i kept praying was, God please blind them from all my inadequacies and trust me this prayer worked like magic..hahahahha.<br><br><b>PCC: </b><br>I applied for Nigeria and UK PCC. Mr Moshood was of great help when i applied for the Nigeria PCC. Though he made some errors on my PCC, but Lucia was very helpful as she helped me apply for another and scanned it to me. <br><br><b>ADRs</b>:<br>I recieved my first ADR on Sept 20th and it was to fill Schedule A form, of which i did immediately and submitted.<br>Second ADR came in October, which was to make payment for RPRF. Made this payment immediately.<br>Third ADR came in and lo and behold, i thought it was PPR not knowing i had another form to fill up. This time around, it had to do with filling the IMM5406 form (additional family information). As usual, i responded swiftly.<br><br><b>GCMS NOTES:  </b><br>Ordered first set of gcms notes on the 24th of November, 2018, and for over 60days it wasn't delivered. Mailed them severally and kept getting all sort of excuses. Atlast, gcmsbuddy had to re-order and it arrived on the 9th of Feb, 2019. Everything look cool. The wait continued<br><br>In all these, it's been a long wait...some will say long overdue but i must say it is worth the wait. At some point i almost lost it 'cos i was beginning to get fed up with responses from CIC agents. Disturbing CIC agents became a hobby to me, as i kept calling and calling...dats how i spoke to one agent thrice on different occassions..lolz...but shun, this lady's voice is something else...often felt at home each time i got connected to her. Will miss her though...hope we get to meet in Cannyland. Psychologically, this process drained me..imagine friends always wanting to know wats going on in this life of dis dude who just got back from UK...enemies at the gate i must say...but God pass them. I no wan mention all dos ""cats"" (babes) wey don chop my UK money run....lolzzz.. dey go soon come back to chop Canny money...Chop keee una there...hahahahaha... <br><br>Emotionally, it was hard for me...thinking about the whole process and thinking about a sick dad who keeps asking...""my son, when are they gonna send the mail?...are you sure this thing will work out?...it became a regular thing that each time i watched his face and have the thoughts of FSW Express Entry, i simply got weak. One thing is for sure, he gave me a big smile early this morning when i got the golden mail..been a while i saw him smile though. One thing is for sure, i am happy he is strong to see this become a reality....no worry, na canny doctors go treat u las las.

I possibly couldn't believe my eyes until i got a mail from Home Office reminding me that i had some months left on my Visa. I was like na so this people wan thank me for spending millions running a Masters programme? At this point, i pinched myself and i was like...""oboy wetin u wan go do for naija""? To start from the scratch? Mbanu !!! I thought of applying for scholarships in the UK and US but for the UK, i was like never!!!.. not after breaking my back all in d name of warehouse jobs...lolzz omor i huzzle shaaa oooo. Options like residency in Australia and Canada became my best bets but I rather chose the Canada route and came across this thread..the rest is history.<br><br><b>IELTS:</b>  <br>My first IELTS test was in the UK, and i prepared for two weeks. First IELTS was LRWS: 7.5, 7.5, 8.0, 8.5...I was so excited thinking that was gonna fetch me a good CRS not knowing i needed atleast an 8.0 in the listening band. I really appreciate the great guys here who encouraged me to retake the test. Got back to Nigeria in January 2018 and decided to retake IELTS, this time around in March. Had ample time to prepare and was very much relaxed in the hall. My second IELTS test was LRWS: 8.0, 7.0, 7.5, 7.5 which was enough for me. As for the materials i used, i basically used online platforms like ieltliz, ieltsbuddy.com and ielts-up.com.<br><br><b>ECA</b><br>This was straightforward as i evaluated just my Masters degree. WES was at my service and did the needful. Being a foreign degree, it was a smooth process for me, and i had my evaluation done within a month or thereabout.<br><b><br>MEDICALS</b><br>This was quite straightforward. Had mine at Prime Medicals in Port Harcourt. Unfortunately, they are no longer part of the process.<br><br><b>PROOF OF FUNDS(POF)</b><br>Used 100% gift deed from my dad. This was transferred to my savings account and transfer document for that was secured. Many have been of the opinion that notarizing the gift deed isn't necessary. Personally i notarized mine. For the gift deed, i simply followed the format put up by wakanowdotcom. His post was really helpful. Other documents i submitted are: <br>&gt;6-month bank statement showing inflow of cash and transfer of POF. <br>&gt;Also got a printout of currency converter (oanda and xe.com) as at day of submission, <br>&gt;LOE explaining source of funds and bulk sum and,<br>&gt; bank reference letter.<br>NO PAYSLIPS WAS INCLUDED. I contemplated including one, but when i got necessary advice from the likes of Tojued and Newmum0615, i had to submit my application without including payslips. Happytbaby, glitteringstar, ugoiyke79e, thanks for all your mails. I so disturbed these guys and trust me, they were of great help. <br><br><b>EMPLOYMENT:</b><br>This was the point i needed my God to step into the matter...lolzzzz.. I actually worked in a firm where i was paid in cash, and all i did was to get a reference letter from my boss in CIC format. I also included an LOE stating the reason i was paid in cash. It was indicated on the letter that i was paid in cash. As for online presence, the firm had no online presence like a website, and i had to including a screenshot of the firm's registration page on the CAC's website. Lastly, i included my boss's complimentary card just incase they decide to reach him directly. In all, i committed everything to God. One prayer i kept praying was, God please blind them from all my inadequacies and trust me this prayer worked like magic..hahahahha.<br><br><b>PCC: </b><br>I applied for Nigeria and UK PCC. Mr Moshood was of great help when i applied for the Nigeria PCC. Though he made some errors on my PCC, but Lucia was very helpful as she helped me apply for another and scanned it to me. <br><br><b>ADRs</b>:<br>I recieved my first ADR on Sept 20th and it was to fill Schedule A form, of which i did immediately and submitted.<br>Second ADR came in October, which was to make payment for RPRF. Made this payment immediately.<br>Third ADR came in and lo and behold, i thought it was PPR not knowing i had another form to fill up. This time around, it had to do with filling the IMM5406 form (additional family information). As usual, i responded swiftly.<br><br><b>GCMS NOTES:  </b><br>Ordered first set of gcms notes on the 24th of November, 2018, and for over 60days it wasn't delivered. Mailed them severally and kept getting all sort of excuses. Atlast, gcmsbuddy had to re-order and it arrived on the 9th of Feb, 2019. Everything look cool. The wait continued<br><br>In all these, it's been a long wait...some will say long overdue but i must say it is worth the wait. At some point i almost lost it 'cos i was beginning to get fed up with responses from CIC agents. Disturbing CIC agents became a hobby to me, as i kept calling and calling...dats how i spoke to one agent thrice on different occassions..lolz...but shun, this lady's voice is something else...often felt at home each time i got connected to her. Will miss her though...hope we get to meet in Cannyland.

I still think maybe it is not mine and they switched results.  <br><br>I am grateful to @Es.hay for introducing me to the Cannyland journey, this platform and thread, guiding me and sharing her experiences while I prepared for the exams. You are my angel. May our dreams come true  <img src=""https://www.nairaland.com/faces/kiss.gif"" alt=""kiss"" border=""0"" class=""faces""><br><br>I prepared for a month. <br><br>Listening: Practice and concentration is the key. I practiced at least 3 times a week. First results were poor but over time it got better. Know the scores you need to get an 8 (36/40 minimum) and never give up until you can score it in at least 6-7 practice tests consecutively.  @happy.me31 is so right, that listening tip helped me too especially part 2, 3, and 4. I remember it was a lady that scored so high in part 6 that gave that tip. Practice writing out keys parts of the conversation as you hear them, especially for those academic and touring conversations (part 3 and 4). This will be so useful for answers that are synonyms of what was spoken. For instance, in part 3 of my exam, the supervisor told the student that her presentation was too sudden and the answer was Abrupt. She told the student that she was also too slow, too fast in her speaking and the answer was Irregular. Writing out that conversation helped me identify the synonyms as I rechecked. In those sections, where you have A, B, C options, You would waste a lot of time and lose concentration if you are looking for the answers while the conversation is on. Write out key words and points. Part 1 and sometimes part 2 are straightforward, no need to write all, just listen carefully. If you miss an answer, MOVE ON FAST, don't panic or think about it.  <br><br>Reading: Skimming and scanning are the keys. The answers are sequential through the passage but they can be tricky. In passage 3 of my exam, the last two answers were in the second paragraph because it mentioned two sentences about outdoor jobs, while the rest of the paragraphs were about indoor jobs. When you cannot find the answer, move on immediately and finish the rest, then return to those unknown questions and read the passages carefully sentence by sentence in that paragraph you think it is, you will find it, depending on how much time you have. While practicing, I noticed my weakness was the difference between False and Not Given, so I spent more time on those parts.<br><br>Speaking: Telling a story in part 2 and talkativeness in all the parts are the keys. As @happy.me31 pointed out, Jay's videos are the best. I also watched past interviews of band 9 candidates and asked myself why they were deserving of band 9. They never stopped talking and used the right vocabulary for the topic. Talk so much and allow the examiner to get tired and stop you (Be a talkative on that day, even if you are not naturally one). It does not matter if you have no idea. If you are unlucky like me to be asked about tough topics like Global Trade, importation and exportation between countries and sustainability in businesses in part 3, still say anything. I paused and told the examiner that this was a tough question because economics is not my strength but I will answer it anyhow based on my layman's knowledge. I used the example of computer village, Nigeria's population and our hustling spirit as the country's best export. I knew I did not make sense but I was determined to keep talking. I just kept thinking of President Trump who says rubbish with so much confidence and still gets supporters, lol. <br><br>Writing: Structure and complex sentences are the keys. Just like @happyme31 said, Jay's video was my only guide. Please use the first 2 minutes to understand the question and what is required. Then use the next three minutes to draw an outline in your question paper of points you want to write. May a sketchy outline so you do not get stuck in the middle of your writing especially for Task 2.  Practice using different kinds of sentences (passive, complex, compound questions, etc. Avoid writing in simple sentences). Also, use transitional words like your life depends on them (However, even though, although, yet, still, nevertheless, etc). Use uncommon words as long as they make sense (critics, cousine, turbulence, flabbergasted, etc, write like those  village headmasters of those days who use big grammars that make sense). Also keep writing, do not stop, collect extra sheet (you can only do this if you have drawn an outline of your ideas). <br><br>For task 2, fill at most three pages or three and a half. Structure is everything in task two, there is a template for writing from Jay's video (introduction, four to five paragraphs for body and elaborate on your ideas, then conclusion). Elaborate on each point in each paragraph (use examples, quote researches and studies (whether they are true or not, the examiner does not care about whether that research really exists), use your personal experiences as a student, worker, mother, father, Nigerian, hustler, business man anything). As you write, imagine you are a debater in the room trying to convince, expantiate, elaborate or prove to your listener about points. Finally, don't be like me, please proofread, allocate the last five minutes to proof read and edit all your tasks. I think I was only fortunate that I write error-free sentences on first draft, but maybe if I had edited, I would have scored higher (maybe, or maybe I scored lower but God touched the examiner's heart). Editing helps and might improve your score by .5 which might make a big difference. <br><br>Most importantly, avoid over-confidence. This exam is about technique and strategy, not English knowledge. I am at the level of a native speaker and very advanced user in my profession but I practiced like it was German or Chinese I was preparing for.  And after writing the exams, pray, pray, pray to any God you believe in. <br><br>Apologies for the long post but I just wanted to help like previous posters in part 6 have helped me too.<br><br>ECA is in the final evaluation stage with Wes. Once it comes, I will dive into the pool. I am currently gathering post-ITA docs because my CRS score is really high (thanks to IELTS scores) as our seniors here have advised potential CRS high scorers. <br><br><br>Fingers crossed for us all in every stage of our journeys.

"<div class=""narrow"">Silent reader but not anymore, lol. Decided on this journey January 2019. <br><br>Wrote ielts 09 Feb (first attempt)<br><br>LRWS: 8.5, 8.5, 8, 8. Overall band= 8.5. I saw my result and could not believe. I still think maybe it is not mine and they switched results.  <br><br>I am grateful to @Eshay for introducing me to the Cannyland journey, this platform and thread, guiding me and sharing her experiences while I prepared for the exams. You are my angel. May our dreams come true  <img src=""https://www.nairaland.com/faces/kiss.gif"" alt=""kiss"" border=""0"" class=""faces""><br><br>I prepared for a month. <br><br>Listening: Practice and concentration is the key. I practiced at least 3 times a week. First results were poor but over time it got better. Know the scores you need to get an 8 (36/40 minimum) and never give up until you can score it in at least 6-7 practice tests consecutively.  @happyme31 is so right, that listening tip helped me too especially part 2, 3, and 4. I remember it was a lady that scored so high in part 6 that gave that tip. Practice writing out keys parts of the conversation as you hear them, especially for those academic and touring conversations (part 3 and 4). This will be so useful for answers that are synonyms of what was spoken. For instance, in part 3 of my exam, the supervisor told the student that her presentation was too sudden and the answer was Abrupt. She told the student that she was also too slow, too fast in her speaking and the answer was Irregular. Writing out that conversation helped me identify the synonyms as I rechecked. In those sections, where you have A, B, C options, You would waste a lot of time and lose concentration if you are looking for the answers while the conversation is on. Write out key words and points. Part 1 and sometimes part 2 are straightforward, no need to write all, just listen carefully. If you miss an answer, MOVE ON FAST, don't panic or think about it.  <br><br>Reading: Skimming and scanning are the keys. The answers are sequential through the passage but they can be tricky. In passage 3 of my exam, the last two answers were in the second paragraph because it mentioned two sentences about outdoor jobs, while the rest of the paragraphs were about indoor jobs. When you cannot find the answer, move on immediately and finish the rest, then return to those unknown questions and read the passages carefully sentence by sentence in that paragraph you think it is, you will find it, depending on how much time you have. While practicing, I noticed my weakness was the difference between False and Not Given, so I spent more time on those parts.<br><br>Speaking: Telling a story in part 2 and talkativeness in all the parts are the keys. As @happyme31 pointed out, Jay's videos are the best. I also watched past interviews of band 9 candidates and asked myself why they were deserving of band 9. They never stopped talking and used the right vocabulary for the topic. Talk so much and allow the examiner to get tired and stop you (Be a talkative on that day, even if you are not naturally one). It does not matter if you have no idea. If you are unlucky like me to be asked about tough topics like Global Trade, importation and exportation between countries and sustainability in businesses in part 3, still say anything. I paused and told the examiner that this was a tough question because economics is not my strength but I will answer it anyhow based on my layman's knowledge. I used the example of computer village, Nigeria's population and our hustling spirit as the country's best export. I knew I did not make sense but I was determined to keep talking. I just kept thinking of President Trump who says rubbish with so much confidence and still gets supporters, lol. <br><br>Writing: Structure and complex sentences are the keys. Just like @happyme31 said, Jay's video was my only guide. Please use the first 2 minutes to understand the question and what is required. Then use the next three minutes to draw an outline in your question paper of points you want to write. May a sketchy outline so you do not get stuck in the middle of your writing especially for Task 2.  Practice using different kinds of sentences (passive, complex, compound questions, etc. Avoid writing in simple sentences). Also, use transitional words like your life depends on them (However, even though, although, yet, still, nevertheless, etc). Use uncommon words as long as they make sense (critics, cousine, turbulence, flabbergasted, etc, write like those  village headmasters of those days who use big grammars that make sense). Also keep writing, do not stop, collect extra sheet (you can only do this if you have drawn an outline of your ideas). <br><br>For task 2, fill at most three pages or three and a half. Structure is everything in task two, there is a template for writing from Jay's video (introduction, four to five paragraphs for body and elaborate on your ideas, then conclusion). Elaborate on each point in each paragraph (use examples, quote researches and studies (whether they are true or not, the examiner does not care about whether that research really exists), use your personal experiences as a student, worker, mother, father, Nigerian, hustler, business man anything). As you write, imagine you are a debater in the room trying to convince, expantiate, elaborate or prove to your listener about points. Finally, don't be like me, please proofread, allocate the last five minutes to proof read and edit all your tasks. I think I was only fortunate that I write error-free sentences on first draft, but maybe if I had edited, I would have scored higher (maybe, or maybe I scored lower but God touched the examiner's heart). Editing helps and might improve your score by .5 which might make a big difference. <br><br>Most importantly, avoid over-confidence. This exam is about technique and strategy, not English knowledge. I am at the level of a native speaker and very advanced user in my profession but I practiced like it was German or Chinese I was preparing for.  And after writing the exams, pray, pray, pray to any God you believe in. <br><br>Apologies for the long post but I just wanted to help like previous posters in part 6 have helped me too.<br><br>ECA is in the final evaluation stage with Wes. Once it comes, I will dive into the pool. I am currently gathering post-ITA docs because my CRS score is really high (thanks to IELTS scores) as our seniors here have advised potential CRS high scorers. <br><br><br>Fingers crossed for us all in every stage of our journeys. May our dreams come true. It will end in praise.</div>",12:34pm,Feb-22,2019

"<div class=""narrow"">Hey I reside in Germany and in the centers, headphones are not used. I think you can re-mark the exam. If you decide to re-write, can you indicate in your application that you have a hearing need and would like to sit at the front seat or perhaps if an headphone can be provided. I know a candidate at my center that did this and his request was granted to sit at the front seat, closest to the speaker. <br><br><blockquote><a href=""/post/75984338""><b>Compu001</b></a>:<br>Please if you are in Europe and you know of any IELTS center that use headphones for their listening test, please help me with it.

What materials did you study with? What were your practice test scores in LR.Do you review your answers and note the questions you were failing?

Study in various stress conditions, low volume, high volume etc. Try to do both listening and reading at a stretch, simulate exam conditions as much as possible. Practice all writing question prompts. For writing, I'll recommend ielts liz paid video, that was what I used. Finally, you should join the ielts WhatsApp group. I'm rooting for you in the next test.

I believe my file was transferred late September.  When I found out my application was at AVO I was so disheartened ehn.  I tried to find information online about this VO and all I could see were people who submitted their passports to Accra discussing timelines.  It wasn't until that petition was raised that I realised there was a whatsapp group.

Nigerian was from our Inspector.  I filled the form and mailed to him. <br><br>POF was USD account with above required POF for my family size,  but I added my Naira account and 25% of Pension funds which also added up to above required POF. <br><br>I claimed sibling point and I added our birth certificates from NPC,  parents' marriage certificate,  sibling's Canadian passport and Canadian driving licence.<br><br>I completed Schedule A upfront because of the many address changes I have.  <br><br>I applied as Legally Separated. Below are a list of documents I submitted.  Admin, consider pining this to page 1.

And an explanation on why I withdrew the case. <br><br>Signed and notarized consent to apply for PR and consent to Travel with our child. It helps that my soon to be ex spouse and I are actually quite friendly. <br>So getting these forms were a breeze. <br><br>We considered having my parents in law (I refuse to call them ex.

This was because we did not have any legal documents to explain our status then. We actually had to attend an interview as our country of residence does not have drop box. I was afraid they would think we were actually still together.  <br><br>I see lots of new inquiries about divorce and separation.

Decided on this journey January 2019. <br><br>Wrote ielts 09 Feb (first attempt)<br><br>LRWS: 8.5, 8.5, 8, 8. Overall band= 8.5. I saw my result and could not believe. I still think maybe it is not mine and they switched results.  <br><br>I am grateful to @Eshay for introducing me to the Cannyland journey, this platform and thread, guiding me and sharing her experiences while I prepared for the exams. You are my angel. May our dreams come true  <img src=""https://www.nairaland.com/faces/kiss.gif"" alt=""kiss"" border=""0"" class=""faces""><br><br>I prepared for a month. <br><br>Listening: Practice and concentration is the key. I practiced at least 3 times a week. First results were poor but over time it got better. Know the scores you need to get an 8 (36/40 minimum) and never give up until you can score it in at least 6-7 practice tests consecutively.  @happyme31 is so right, that listening tip helped me too especially part 2, 3, and 4. I remember it was a lady that scored so high in part 6 that gave that tip. Practice writing out keys parts of the conversation as you hear them, especially for those academic and touring conversations (part 3 and 4). This will be so useful for answers that are synonyms of what was spoken. For instance, in part 3 of my exam, the supervisor told the student that her presentation was too sudden and the answer was Abrupt. She told the student that she was also too slow, too fast in her speaking and the answer was Irregular. Writing out that conversation helped me identify the synonyms as I rechecked. In those sections, where you have A, B, C options, You would waste a lot of time and lose concentration if you are looking for the answers while the conversation is on. Write out key words and points. Part 1 and sometimes part 2 are straightforward, no need to write all, just listen carefully. If you miss an answer, MOVE ON FAST, don't panic or think about it.  <br><br>Reading: Skimming and scanning are the keys. The answers are sequential through the passage but they can be tricky. In passage 3 of my exam, the last two answers were in the second paragraph because it mentioned two sentences about outdoor jobs, while the rest of the paragraphs were about indoor jobs. When you cannot find the answer, move on immediately and finish the rest, then return to those unknown questions and read the passages carefully sentence by sentence in that paragraph you think it is, you will find it, depending on how much time you have. While practicing, I noticed my weakness was the difference between False and Not Given, so I spent more time on those parts.<br><br>Speaking: Telling a story in part 2 and talkativeness in all the parts are the keys. As @happyme31 pointed out, Jay's videos are the best. I also watched past interviews of band 9 candidates and asked myself why they were deserving of band 9. They never stopped talking and used the right vocabulary for the topic. Talk so much and allow the examiner to get tired and stop you (Be a talkative on that day, even if you are not naturally one). It does not matter if you have no idea. If you are unlucky like me to be asked about tough topics like Global Trade, importation and exportation between countries and sustainability in businesses in part 3, still say anything. I paused and told the examiner that this was a tough question because economics is not my strength but I will answer it anyhow based on my layman's knowledge. I used the example of computer village, Nigeria's population and our hustling spirit as the country's best export. I knew I did not make sense but I was determined to keep talking. I just kept thinking of President Trump who says rubbish with so much confidence and still gets supporters, lol. <br><br>Writing: Structure and complex sentences are the keys. Just like @happyme31 said, Jay's video was my only guide. Please use the first 2 minutes to understand the question and what is required. Then use the next three minutes to draw an outline in your question paper of points you want to write. May a sketchy outline so you do not get stuck in the middle of your writing especially for Task 2.  Practice using different kinds of sentences (passive, complex, compound questions, etc. Avoid writing in simple sentences). Also, use transitional words like your life depends on them (However, even though, although, yet, still, nevertheless, etc). Use uncommon words as long as they make sense (critics, cousine, turbulence, flabbergasted, etc, write like those  village headmasters of those days who use big grammars that make sense). Also keep writing, do not stop, collect extra sheet (you can only do this if you have drawn an outline of your ideas). <br><br>For task 2, fill at most three pages or three and a half. Structure is everything in task two, there is a template for writing from Jay's video (introduction, four to five paragraphs for body and elaborate on your ideas, then conclusion). Elaborate on each point in each paragraph (use examples, quote researches and studies (whether they are true or not, the examiner does not care about whether that research really exists), use your personal experiences as a student, worker, mother, father, Nigerian, hustler, business man anything). As you write, imagine you are a debater in the room trying to convince, expantiate, elaborate or prove to your listener about points. Finally, don't be like me, please proofread, allocate the last five minutes to proof read and edit all your tasks. I think I was only fortunate that I write error-free sentences on first draft, but maybe if I had edited, I would have scored higher (maybe, or maybe I scored lower but God touched the examiner's heart). Editing helps and might improve your score by .5 which might make a big difference. <br><br>Most importantly, avoid over-confidence. This exam is about technique and strategy, not English knowledge. I am at the level of a native speaker and very advanced user in my profession but I practiced like it was German or Chinese I was preparing for.  And after writing the exams, pray, pray, pray to any God you believe in. <br><br>Apologies for the long post but I just wanted to help like previous posters in part 6 have helped me too.<br><br>ECA is in the final evaluation stage with Wes. Once it comes, I will dive into the pool. I am currently gathering post-ITA docs because my CRS score is really high (thanks to IELTS scores) as our seniors here have advised potential CRS high scorers. <br><br><br>Fingers crossed for us all in every stage of our journeys.

Overall band 7.5. Really not sure what to do next because this leaves my CRS score at 435 but I really don't feel like taking the test a second time. I'm quite disappointed anyway because the test seemed easy enough, in fact I wasn't expecting anything less than a 9 in both reading and listening. I also followed Jay's methods for the writing but obviously I must have done something wrong.

I still think maybe it is not mine and they switched results.  <br><br>I am grateful to @Eshay for introducing me to the Cannyland journey, this platform and thread, guiding me and sharing her experiences while I prepared for the exams. You are my angel. May our dreams come true  <img src=""https://www.nairaland.com/faces/kiss.gif"" alt=""kiss"" border=""0"" class=""faces""><br><br>I prepared for a month. <br><br>Listening: Practice and concentration is the key. I practiced at least 3 times a week. First results were poor but over time it got better. Know the scores you need to get an 8 (36/40 minimum) and never give up until you can score it in at least 6-7 practice tests consecutively.  @happyme31 is so right, that listening tip helped me too especially part 2, 3, and 4. I remember it was a lady that scored so high in part 6 that gave that tip. Practice writing out keys parts of the conversation as you hear them, especially for those academic and touring conversations (part 3 and 4). This will be so useful for answers that are synonyms of what was spoken. For instance, in part 3 of my exam, the supervisor told the student that her presentation was too sudden and the answer was Abrupt. She told the student that she was also too slow, too fast in her speaking and the answer was Irregular. Writing out that conversation helped me identify the synonyms as I rechecked. In those sections, where you have A, B, C options, You would waste a lot of time and lose concentration if you are looking for the answers while the conversation is on. Write out key words and points. Part 1 and sometimes part 2 are straightforward, no need to write all, just listen carefully. If you miss an answer, MOVE ON FAST, don't panic or think about it.  <br><br>Reading: Skimming and scanning are the keys. The answers are sequential through the passage but they can be tricky. In passage 3 of my exam, the last two answers were in the second paragraph because it mentioned two sentences about outdoor jobs, while the rest of the paragraphs were about indoor jobs. When you cannot find the answer, move on immediately and finish the rest, then return to those unknown questions and read the passages carefully sentence by sentence in that paragraph you think it is, you will find it, depending on how much time you have. While practicing, I noticed my weakness was the difference between False and Not Given, so I spent more time on those parts.<br><br>Speaking: Telling a story in part 2 and talkativeness in all the parts are the keys. As @happyme31 pointed out, Jay's videos are the best. I also watched past interviews of band 9 candidates and asked myself why they were deserving of band 9. They never stopped talking and used the right vocabulary for the topic. Talk so much and allow the examiner to get tired and stop you (Be a talkative on that day, even if you are not naturally one). It does not matter if you have no idea. If you are unlucky like me to be asked about tough topics like Global Trade, importation and exportation between countries and sustainability in businesses in part 3, still say anything. I paused and told the examiner that this was a tough question because economics is not my strength but I will answer it anyhow based on my layman's knowledge. I used the example of computer village, Nigeria's population and our hustling spirit as the country's best export. I knew I did not make sense but I was determined to keep talking. I just kept thinking of President Trump who says rubbish with so much confidence and still gets supporters, lol. <br><br>Writing: Structure and complex sentences are the keys. Just like @happyme31 said, Jay's video was my only guide. Please use the first 2 minutes to understand the question and what is required. Then use the next three minutes to draw an outline in your question paper of points you want to write. May a sketchy outline so you do not get stuck in the middle of your writing especially for Task 2.  Practice using different kinds of sentences (passive, complex, compound questions, etc. Avoid writing in simple sentences). Also, use transitional words like your life depends on them (However, even though, although, yet, still, nevertheless, etc). Use uncommon words as long as they make sense (critics, cousine, turbulence, flabbergasted, etc, write like those  village headmasters of those days who use big grammars that make sense). Also keep writing, do not stop, collect extra sheet (you can only do this if you have drawn an outline of your ideas). <br><br>For task 2, fill at most three pages or three and a half. Structure is everything in task two, there is a template for writing from Jay's video (introduction, four to five paragraphs for body and elaborate on your ideas, then conclusion). Elaborate on each point in each paragraph (use examples, quote researches and studies (whether they are true or not, the examiner does not care about whether that research really exists), use your personal experiences as a student, worker, mother, father, Nigerian, hustler, business man anything). As you write, imagine you are a debater in the room trying to convince, expantiate, elaborate or prove to your listener about points. Finally, don't be like me, please proofread, allocate the last five minutes to proof read and edit all your tasks. I think I was only fortunate that I write error-free sentences on first draft, but maybe if I had edited, I would have scored higher (maybe, or maybe I scored lower but God touched the examiner's heart). Editing helps and might improve your score by .5 which might make a big difference. <br><br>Most importantly, avoid over-confidence. This exam is about technique and strategy, not English knowledge. I am at the level of a native speaker and very advanced user in my profession but I practiced like it was German or Chinese I was preparing for.  And after writing the exams, pray, pray, pray to any God you believe in. <br><br>Apologies for the long post but I just wanted to help like previous posters in part 6 have helped me too.<br><br>ECA is in the final evaluation stage with Wes. Once it comes, I will dive into the pool. I am currently gathering post-ITA docs because my CRS score is really high (thanks to IELTS scores) as our seniors here have advised potential CRS high scorers. <br><br><br>Fingers crossed for us all in every stage of our journeys. May our dreams come true. It will end in praise. </blockquote></div>",6:17pm,Feb-22,2019

"<div class=""narrow"">It has began in praise!<br><br>Wrote IELTS (BC) for the first time on 9th February.<br><br>Result: LRSW - 9,9,8.5,7<br><br>Prepared for about 1month.<br><br>LISTENING: I really didn't use any video. I practised mainly with the Cambridge materials. I discovered I had major challenge with the MCQ questions, so I learnt to:<br>-focus more<br>-get involved in the discussion by creating a mental picture and this helped my concentration<br>-practice more and more.<br>Funny enough, I still scored below 36 a number of time during the exam week.<br><br>READING: I started with one very difficult material I downloaded from pdf drive. It really scared me cos I couldn't get above 34, my average was 30. When I finally got the Cambridge material, I was getting 38, 39 &amp; 40. My main challenge here was the T, F, NG questions.<br>-it is TRUE: if the statement can be FOUND (without assumption) in the passage<br>-it is FALSE: if the statement is COMPLETELY opposite to what's in the passage<br>-it is NOT GIVEN: if there's no info at all about the statement in the passage<br>NB: Don't assume anything based on previous knowledge, it's all about the given passage.<br><br>SPEAKING: I really didn't do much preparation here cos I'm naturally as chatty person, I can make up stories easily. I got some questions from IELTSLiz website and watched her videos. Practised the difficult ones with a friend some days before the test. On the test day, I just flowed with the guy as a friend. He practically had to cut me short on almost all questions.<br><br>READING: Hmmmmmm... na here my wahala &amp; nightmare deyyyy. I dreaded the writing when I was seeing the failure rate. Long story short, I used Jay's, Chris Pell 5-day challenge &amp; IELTS UP videos (all from YouTube)... and they helped to reduce my fear. Then @wasseynewest (God bless you sir!) came to the rescue my adding me to a free WhatsApp group for writing and the tutor was quite good with criticising my writing especially task 2.<br><br>Still awaiting ECA though, CRS is 456<br><br>It will surely end in praise...!<br><br>Please o, what documents do I need to start gathering to make my submission</div>",3:56am,Feb-23,2019

Really not sure what to do next because this leaves my CRS score at 435 but I really don't feel like taking the test a second time. I'm quite disappointed anyway because the test seemed easy enough, in fact I wasn't expecting anything less than a 9 in both reading and listening. I also followed Jay's methods for the writing but obviously I must have done something wrong.

My main challenge here was the T, F, NG questions.<br>-it is TRUE: if the statement can be FOUND (without assumption) in the passage<br>-it is FALSE: if the statement is COMPLETELY opposite to what's in the passage<br>-it is NOT GIVEN: if there's no info at all about the statement in the passage<br>NB: Don't assume anything based on previous knowledge, it's all about the given passage.<br><br>SPEAKING: I really didn't do much preparation here cos I'm naturally as chatty person, I can make up stories easily.

"<div class=""narrow""><blockquote><a href=""/post/76049728""><b>WhiteUlquiorra</b></a>:<br>Hello nairalanders,<br>I decided to emigrate January 2018 and since then I have been a silent voracious reader of all Canada immigration threads. I'm not exaggerating when I say I probably would not have PPR today without the valuable information obtained here. Now that  the journey is at its end, I feel the need to share my story. Perhaps it would help someone out there. My application is a bit peculiar because my wife got pregnant with our second child sometime in May 2018, so we applied as a family of three with the hope that we would be in Canada by the time the baby is born. As God would have it, progress was slow, baby was born and PPR came a few days later. Instead of sending our passports, we notified IRCC of the change in family composition, provided POF for a family of four and other documents and a second PPR was issued. See timeline below:<br><br>WES completed - 03 Sep 2018<br>IELTS - 04 Sep 2018 (upon EOR of 3rd attempt) <br>ITA - 05 Sep 2018<br>AOR - 11 Oct 2018<br>Biometrics request - 08 Nov 2018<br>Biometrics completed 13 Nov 2018<br>First PPR - 28 Jan 2019<br>CSE to CIC &amp; OVO - 29 Jan 2019<br>Request Letter - 31 Jan 2019<br>Submission of ADR to include new born - 15 Feb 2019<br>Second PPR - 19 Feb 2019<br><br>The lesson here is to not loose hope. Things did not move along as smoothly as described in the timeline especially with the WES and IELTS but that's a story for another day. Commit it to God, do your research, perservere and you'll be fine. </blockquote><br>Congratulations! The Lord really has done a good thing!!! Cheers to our new CannyBaby!<br><br>Congratulations to all recent PPR recipients. May our new country favour you!</div>",12:35pm,Feb-24,2019

"<div class=""narrow"">Honestly, it’s tough and yet, possible. Very possible. Quite a number of people have gotten jobs in Canada from Nigeria.

Programs like the Atlantic Immigration Pilot Program (AIPP) and Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) have somehow made it easier than it previously was, and are alternative areas to explore.<br><br>For the AIPP, there are lists of employers (in the Atlantic provinces such as New Brunswick and Noca Scotia) who opt in or are designated to take part in the program.

"<div class=""narrow"">Hello, you are very comfortable economically so I will advice you to think through your decision to migrate very carefully. <br><br>If the PR (and perhaps eventual citizenship) is your primary motivation, then yes migrate, <br><br>If it is to secure a better future for your kids, think carefully, because you can as well send them over there to study and settle if you can afford it, while you keep your job in Naija.<br><br>If it is to continue your career in Canada from where it is in Nigeria, I do not think it will be wise to just abandon your high-income job and move permanently. Why not test the ground first? Go for business holidays in Canada (you can afford it), go for job fairs/professional/business conferences during your vacation, make Canadian ""business"" friends, impress them with your skills and personality, network with companies and international peers working in Canada offline and on linkedin and let them know your career plans. I have met rich Nigerian professionals who do this here in Germany before deciding whether to settle here or not. You might be fortunate that some of those you meet might give you a call and ask you to consider moving to work with them. Then you can assess the feasibility of getting a lead or managerial position as a new Canadian or resident and decide if it is worth it.  <br><br>Some have been ok to do underpaid jobs (not survival jobs, but temporary/contract short term jobs) on arrival for a few years/months before getting the right job for them, if you can endure this, then maybe.<br><br>Read this link (it is a query about an engineering job, but look at the replies about salary expectations below on that page, the guy making the enquiry from Indian is almost on the same salary as you, 140 000 CAD)<br><br><a href=""https://www.canadavisa.com/canada-immigration-discussion-board/threads/how-difficult-easy-is-it-for-a-pr-candidate-to-find-a-software-engineering-job.474279/"">https://www.canadavisa.com/canada-immigration-discussion-board/threads/how-difficult-easy-is-it-for-a-pr-candidate-to-find-a-software-engineering-job.474279/</a><br><br>Also so you know what it involves in finding a job as a new comer, check this link<br><br><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-i-learned-finding-job-newcomer-canada-ronak-gandhi-mba-b-tech"">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-i-learned-finding-job-newcomer-canada-ronak-gandhi-mba-b-tech</a><br><br><br>Follow the ""Living in Canada"" thread here and connect with Nigerians who have relocated to understand how they have been able to secure jobs and settle in. <br><br>Do your intensive research first. If I had your salary, I would not even think of leaving Nigeria, I would only think of resettling my future children and securing a passport of a Western country, which you can do through other means, if you know what I mean. <br><br>For more experienced workers (in managerial positions), specialised professions requiring licenses without PNPs, the biggest challenge you will face will be the ""License requirement"" and ""Canadian experience/Canadian Born"" obstacle for many job positions. Of course this challenge rarely applies to fresh young graduates or early career professionals, because it is easier getting graduate entry positions and starting with Canadian experience from the scratch. <br><br>I wish you all the best in this journey, if you eventually decide on it.   <br><br><blockquote><a href=""/post/76027783""><b>KaraDanvers</b></a>:<br> Thinking of FSW. <br><br>The earning of 36m is net salary from Current job. </blockquote></div>",2:29pm,Feb-23,2019

I did some research and then decided I think I want this, an amazing life for me and my kids. I told my baby ( my then bf , now hubby).. he wasn’t interested then o, said you can make it in naija, kinikan kinikan , hmmm . I tried to convince him then, I just said let me start first . Started my WES October 2017, wrote my ielts a month after( passed in one sitting).<br><br><b>WES</b> - Then I mistakenly or just mumuly decided to use nipost for WES just to buy time , maybe baby would agree, that’s how my village people caught up to me o and strike started . The up and down ehn , sorting people , spending money, Wes finally came through. <br><br><b>Work experience/CRS score</b> - Then the wait for 3 years experience nko as I just wanted to use one workplace to claim points.

So I said babe let’s do court na and apply as a couple, baby was like no o, everything is a process, I must propose, then do intro, then court can follow, I said babe hmm adding spouse in between is one kind o. But I can’t propose to my self abi or do court with myself, i sha continued.<br><br><b>ITA</b> - Well, ITA showed up,  I didn’t have issues with POF ( used First bank treasury bills, stanbic fixed deposit , stanbic money market investment funds), Alhamdulillah... I sha chilled till July, so I can add my love in between, so it won’t be too early .<br><br><b>AOR</b> - Hence my AOR July 1st, then the race began, constant profile checking, oh lest I forget , before this I met amazing people in our May ITA group , TEECAN , my brother Threemg(love you bro ), my sissy deesmama(AOR mate) and now close friend, we’re plenty small in that group and I hope our prayers would all be answered soonest.<br><br>I forgot to mention, baby proposed before I even got ITA, then we did a huge introduction ceremony and a small court wedding ceremony , all this while , my file was at Ottawa . Now it was time to add my hubby. Sent a mail, i got ADR, too many requests o, but we did it sha and submitted... they added my baby beginning of October or so..then I got IP2 some days after, Alhamdulillah, was so happy I buzzed deesmama straight that she should check her profile , she didn’t get that day, but got the next day and ppr the Monday afterwards... amazing period <br><br><b>The Wait</b> - Then the wait started, where’s ppr nah, everyone was getting ppr up and down , but the thing didn’t reach me... hmmm...called an agent , the guy was super rude , was just using me to catch cruise...<br>I called like 2 weeks after again then I heard the dreaded news, file was at Accra, I cried ehn, didn’t believe my ears, I told my bro straight @threemg, he said I should not worry, meanwhile I ordered gcms notes, as the first one refused to come (ended up getting here later)...when it finally came all was passed but a section called « other Reqs » showed not started, the type of check was non compliance check, mogbe.. I researched, checked canada visa forum, nothing, my worry was now in full force...<br><br><b>Accra VO gang</b> - Then I joined the Accra VO gang, I’m glad now that Accra VO is performing, there are rumors that they have a processing window of January till March, you might see a lot of PPRs from Accra this period.... I pray they extend this their window so at least they can attend to all, please release my people Abeg... . I Met a couple of friends and caring people in the group,I thought I was going to be depressed in the group, but the support was reassuring....anyways by this time I didn’t check nairaland again before I enter depression things.. @threemg added me to the group, then we all started surviving together...<br><br><b>Interview things</b> - Fast forward to January 14th, request for interview , both me and spouse had to attend, we also had to come with all evidence of our relationship from the onset and they gave us just 2 weeks to prepare.. Ahhhh gbese, called hubby straight , called my bro @threemg... and as you’ve already guessed, I cried ehn, tears couldn’t stop flowing, so many regrets, but I never regretted ever adding my baby, most of the regrets was all around maybe waiting till IP2 or after PPr or adding more documents or something sha..<br><br><i>I must say this, I’m quite pessimistic as well, that didn’t help me in this journey at all...please let’s be optimistic in this journey o, very important Abeg.</i><br><br>My story is long abi, hmm it hasn’t finished o, keep reading...<br><br><br><b>Interview Prep</b>- The documents gathering started, you know this modern day love na soft copies of pictures dey our phone, we used over 20k to print 200pictures... I went to airtel office for phone records between hubby and I, those ones used me to catch cruise too, said they could only give me 3 months worth of records, as a naija girl, i also applied at another office, so I could maybe get 6 months altogether, they caught me sha o ( but I still found a way out)... I took screenshots of our iMessage chats, we exported whatsapp chat, we printed hotel receipts of all our escapades, we printed pictures of gifts we ever gave each other that we snapped, what didn’t we get...hmm<br><br><br><b>The Interview ( Summary)</b><br><br>We took days off, we booked our flights, flew a day before , got in late at night to Accra, then we decided to eat something ( spaghetti and sauce), you see we thought it was familiar, what could be wrong right?.. well here goes, I couldn’t sleep well, I vomited the next morning, hubby was purging... ahh gbese...the devil can’t win naw, after we have come this far...<br><br>Meanwhile our Accra Gang they throway prayer for us, our interview gang too, my May ITA group too, my siblings, my friends.... their prayers were answered o .....<br><br>Interview went amazingly well... lady was nice, hmm... let me rest, would continue later...<br><br><br><i>Cont’d</i><br><br><br>Back to the matter!!<br><br>So we got to the embassy, right on time, they collected all phone, all wristwatches, most things sha, but I still went in with my bag after they searched thoroughly, we dropped our documents with the receptionists and held on to some other supporting docs. We could hear an interview going well, the lady ended up passing and was asked to either come the next day or submit her passports from Lagos. Kai we were happy for her o and gingered ....<br><br>At this time, just hubby and I were at the waiting room, we waited and waited o, they didn’t call us, I even dozed off small, finally after about 1hr 30mins of waiting... I was called, she apologized for the delay, such an amazing lady, she was nice as well... then the questions came o ( another story), highlight was that the interview was almost like a spousal sponsorship interview, i told her the truth, adding interesting information in between, she was just laughing, me sef laugh join...one thing was for sure I made sure all I said was the truth about our relationship, because hubby was next  and our answers at least had to match small.....<br><br><b>The Verdict</b> - Hubby’s turn, she asked almost the same things, it went well o.... then she asked hubby to call me, and then she told us the good news , that we passed , you need to see the way we jumped, then she said in that moment when I told you guys, I could see the love, mehn we beamed even more. She then asked when we were traveling, we said tonight, she said they can only stamp our passports and issue COPR tomorrow or we wait till we get back to lagos, hubby said when we get to lagos ..... sigh<br><br>Hmm, we sha told her thank you and left... I was happy and sad ( left to me , we go reschedule flight and collect our thing sharply next day), but hubby kept saying he had to go back, I cried and cried , kept wondering why he didn’t see the importance the way I did... hmmm... didn’t talk to him o... finally I couldn’t stand to see him feeling so bad, sha told him how I felt and we settled...<br><br>Off to lagos back, Shebi all is well that ends well, next day ppr mail entered, I was so freaking happy, called hubby straight, told my Accra and Interview gang, I sharply carry passport say make I go submit. Got to hubby’s car o, na so stomach pain start again( at this time I knew village people were really trying , but I also knew Allah was stronger than them)... hubby rushed me to the emergency room in the hospital o, took drip, hubby stayed with me for a while... then I went back home as I was cleared...<br><br><b>Then I submitted the next day...</b><br><br><br>I know my story is very long, I even missed out some part , so that people won’t get bored and to conceal my identity lol. This journey was something else...all my friends had gotten , people I put through, I knew the process to a large extent , why my journey was longer, I don’t know but I know Allah knows best ...<br><br>I didn’t call out advices, but I’m sure if you read my story well, you would have picked one or two...oh and if you find out you have an interview with your spouse due to addition or something, don’t be scared , you can also reach out to me...<br><br>I sincerely thank all my friends, my family, my newly made friends from whatsapp support groups, nairaland forum and friends made here.... without the support, I may have given up.<br><br>Now I pray for good health as we must get to our second country InshaAllah...<br><br>It ended in praise .

"<div class=""narrow""><blockquote><a href=""/post/76028448""><b>Topsmamen</b></a>:<br>Honestly, it’s tough and yet, possible. Very possible. Quite a number of people have gotten jobs in Canada from Nigeria. In retrospect, i used to think it’s sheer luck for someone to be employed from Canada as employers would rather employ applicants who are already resident in Canada than employ foreigners, irrespective of your experience or expertise. Programs like the Atlantic Immigration Pilot Program (AIPP) and Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) have somehow made it easier than it previously was, and are alternative areas to explore.<br><br>For the AIPP, there are lists of employers (in the Atlantic provinces such as New Brunswick and Noca Scotia) who opt in or are designated to take part in the program. The best course of action would be to look through each of them and apply (if you meet the requirements, of course). It’s possible bro, but not easy. I’ll say.</blockquote>Many thanks for the concise information.</div>",3:38pm,Feb-23,2019

Very possible. Quite a number of people have gotten jobs in Canada from Nigeria. In retrospect, i used to think it’s sheer luck for someone to be employed from Canada as employers would rather employ applicants who are already resident in Canada than employ foreigners, irrespective of your experience or expertise. Programs like the Atlantic Immigration Pilot Program (AIPP) and Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) have somehow made it easier than it previously was, and are alternative areas to explore.<br><br>For the AIPP, there are lists of employers (in the Atlantic provinces such as New Brunswick and Noca Scotia) who opt in or are designated to take part in the program. The best course of action would be to look through each of them and apply (if you meet the requirements, of course). It’s possible bro, but not easy. I’ll say.</blockquote></div>",9:13pm,Feb-23,2019

I practised mainly with the Cambridge materials. I discovered I had major challenge with the MCQ questions, so I learnt to:<br>-focus more<br>-get involved in the discussion by creating a mental picture and this helped my concentration<br>-practice more and more.<br>Funny enough, I still scored below 36 a number of time during the exam week.<br><br>READING: I started with one very difficult material I downloaded from pdf drive. It really scared me cos I couldn't get above 34, my average was 30. When I finally got the Cambridge material, I was getting 38, 39 &amp; 40. My main challenge here was the T, F, NG questions.<br>-it is TRUE: if the statement can be FOUND (without assumption) in the passage<br>-it is FALSE: if the statement is COMPLETELY opposite to what's in the passage<br>-it is NOT GIVEN: if there's no info at all about the statement in the passage<br>NB: Don't assume anything based on previous knowledge, it's all about the given passage.<br><br>SPEAKING: I really didn't do much preparation here cos I'm naturally as chatty person, I can make up stories easily. I got some questions from IELTSLiz website and watched her videos. Practised the difficult ones with a friend some days before the test. On the test day, I just flowed with the guy as a friend. He practically had to cut me short on almost all questions.<br><br>READING: Hmmmmmm... na here my wahala &amp; nightmare deyyyy. I dreaded the writing when I was seeing the failure rate. Long story short, I used Jay's, Chris Pell 5-day challenge &amp; IELTS UP videos (all from YouTube)... and they helped to reduce my fear.

Basically a short letter.  Max 4 sentences saying I was not using this means to circumvent the rules and sponsor an inadmissible person. <br><br>My major fear applying as separated was that my STB ex spouse and I renewed our US visa 1 month before AOR as married.  This was because we did not have any legal documents to explain our status then. We actually had to attend an interview as our country of residence does not have drop box. I was afraid they would think we were actually still together.  <br><br>I see lots of new inquiries about divorce and separation.  There you have it guys.  <br><br>I have submitted my passport already.  Just mine because our child has an American passport.

"<div class=""narrow"">[quote author=ladymarshall post=75990922]Silent reader but not anymore, lol. Decided on this journey January 2019. <br><br>Wrote ielts 09 Feb (first attempt)<br><br>LRWS: 8.5, 8.5, 8, 8. Overall band= 8.5. I saw my result and could not believe. I still think maybe it is not mine and they switched results.  <br><br>I am grateful to @Eshay for introducing me to the Cannyland journey, this platform and thread, guiding me and sharing her experiences while I prepared for the exams. You are my angel. May our dreams come true  <img src=""https://www.nairaland.com/faces/kiss.gif"" alt=""kiss"" border=""0"" class=""faces""><br><br>I prepared for a month. <br><br>Listening: Practice and concentration is the key. I practiced at least 3 times a week. First results were poor but over time it got better. Know the scores you need to get an 8 (36/40 minimum) and never give up until you can score it in at least 6-7 practice tests consecutively.  @happyme31 is so right, that listening tip helped me too especially part 2, 3, and 4. I remember it was a lady that scored so high in part 6 that gave that tip. Practice writing out keys parts of the conversation as you hear them, especially for those academic and touring conversations (part 3 and 4). This will be so useful for answers that are synonyms of what was spoken. For instance, in part 3 of my exam, the supervisor told the student that her presentation was too sudden and the answer was Abrupt. She told the student that she was also too slow, too fast in her speaking and the answer was Irregular. Writing out that conversation helped me identify the synonyms as I rechecked. In those sections, where you have A, B, C options, You would waste a lot of time and lose concentration if you are looking for the answers while the conversation is on. Write out key words and points. Part 1 and sometimes part 2 are straightforward, no need to write all, just listen carefully. If you miss an answer, MOVE ON FAST, don't panic or think about it.  <br><br>Reading: Skimming and scanning are the keys. The answers are sequential through the passage but they can be tricky. In passage 3 of my exam, the last two answers were in the second paragraph because it mentioned two sentences about outdoor jobs, while the rest of the paragraphs were about indoor jobs. When you cannot find the answer, move on immediately and finish the rest, then return to those unknown questions and read the passages carefully sentence by sentence in that paragraph you think it is, you will find it, depending on how much time you have. While practicing, I noticed my weakness was the difference between False and Not Given, so I spent more time on those parts.<br><br>Speaking: Telling a story in part 2 and talkativeness in all the parts are the keys. As @happyme31 pointed out, Jay's videos are the best. <br><br><br><br>Congratulations!<br>You couldn't have said it any better.</div>",5:58pm,Feb-23,2019

"<div class=""narrow""><blockquote><a href=""/post/76049728""><b>WhiteUlquiorra</b></a>:<br>Hello nairalanders,<br>I decided to emigrate January 2018 and since then I have been a silent voracious reader of all Canada immigration threads. I'm not exaggerating when I say I probably would not have PPR today without the valuable information obtained here. Now that  the journey is at its end, I feel the need to share my story. Perhaps it would help someone out there. My application is a bit peculiar because my wife got pregnant with our second child sometime in May 2018, so we applied as a family of three with the hope that we would be in Canada by the time the baby is born.

"<div class=""narrow"">Hello nairalanders,<br>I decided to emigrate January 2018 and since then I have been a silent voracious reader of all Canada immigration threads. I'm not exaggerating when I say I probably would not have PPR today without the valuable information obtained here. Now that  the journey is at its end, I feel the need to share my story. Perhaps it would help someone out there. My application is a bit peculiar because my wife got pregnant with our second child sometime in May 2018, so we applied as a family of three with the hope that we would be in Canada by the time the baby is born. As God would have it, progress was slow, baby was born and PPR came a few days later. Instead of sending our passports, we notified IRCC of the change in family composition, provided POF for a family of four and other documents and a second PPR was issued.

I did some research and then decided I think I want this, an amazing life for me and my kids. I told my baby ( my then bf , now hubby).. he wasn’t interested then o, said you can make it in naija, kinikan kinikan , hmmm . I tried to convince him then, I just said let me start first . Started my WES October 2017, wrote my ielts a month after( passed in one sitting).<br><br><b>WES</b> - Then I mistakenly or just mumuly decided to use nipost for WES just to buy time , maybe baby would agree, that’s how my village people caught up to me o and strike started .

So I said babe let’s do court na and apply as a couple, baby was like no o, everything is a process, I must propose, then do intro, then court can follow, I said babe hmm adding spouse in between is one kind o. But I can’t propose to my self abi or do court with myself, i sha continued.<br><br><b>ITA</b> - Well, ITA showed up,  I didn’t have issues with POF ( used First bank treasury bills, stanbic fixed deposit , stanbic money market investment funds), Alhamdulillah... I sha chilled till July, so I can add my love in between, so it won’t be too early .<br><br><b>AOR</b> - Hence my AOR July 1st, then the race began, constant profile checking, oh lest I forget , before this I met amazing people in our May ITA group , TEECAN , my brother Threemg(love you bro ), my sissy deesmama(AOR mate) and now close friend, we’re plenty small in that group and I hope our prayers would all be answered soonest.<br><br>I forgot to mention, baby proposed before I even got ITA, then we did a huge introduction ceremony and a small court wedding ceremony , all this while , my file was at Ottawa . Now it was time to add my hubby. Sent a mail, i got ADR, too many requests o, but we did it sha and submitted... they added my baby beginning of October or so..then I got IP2 some days after, Alhamdulillah, was so happy I buzzed deesmama straight that she should check her profile , she didn’t get that day, but got the next day and ppr the Monday afterwards... amazing period <br><br><b>The Wait</b> - Then the wait started, where’s ppr nah, everyone was getting ppr up and down , but the thing didn’t reach me... hmmm...called an agent , the guy was super rude , was just using me to catch cruise...<br>I called like 2 weeks after again then I heard the dreaded news, file was at Accra, I cried ehn, didn’t believe my ears, I told my bro straight @threemg, he said I should not worry, meanwhile I ordered gcms notes, as the first one refused to come (ended up getting here later)...when it finally came all was passed but a section called « other Reqs » showed not started, the type of check was non compliance check, mogbe.. I researched, checked canada visa forum, nothing, my worry was now in full force...<br><br><b>Accra VO gang</b> - Then I joined the Accra VO gang, I’m glad now that Accra VO is performing, there are rumors that they have a processing window of January till March, you might see a lot of PPRs from Accra this period.... I pray they extend this their window so at least they can attend to all, please release my people Abeg... . I Met a couple of friends and caring people in the group,I thought I was going to be depressed in the group, but the support was reassuring....anyways by this time I didn’t check nairaland again before I enter depression things.. @threemg added me to the group, then we all started surviving together...<br><br><b>Interview things</b> - Fast forward to January 14th, request for interview , both me and spouse had to attend, we also had to come with all evidence of our relationship from the onset and they gave us just 2 weeks to prepare.. Ahhhh gbese, called hubby straight , called my bro @threemg... and as you’ve already guessed, I cried ehn, tears couldn’t stop flowing, so many regrets, but I never regretted ever adding my baby, most of the regrets was all around maybe waiting till IP2 or after PPr or adding more documents or something sha..<br><br><i>I must say this, I’m quite pessimistic as well, that didn’t help me in this journey at all...please let’s be optimistic in this journey o, very important Abeg.</i><br><br>My story is long abi, hmm it hasn’t finished o, keep reading...<br><br><br><b>Interview Prep</b>- The documents gathering started, you know this modern day love na soft copies of pictures dey our phone, we used over 20k to print 200pictures... I went to airtel office for phone records between hubby and I, those ones used me to catch cruise too, said they could only give me 3 months worth of records, as a naija girl, i also applied at another office, so I could maybe get 6 months altogether, they caught me sha o ( but I still found a way out)... I took screenshots of our iMessage chats, we exported whatsapp chat, we printed hotel receipts of all our escapades, we printed pictures of gifts we ever gave each other that we snapped, what didn’t we get...hmm<br><br><br><b>The Interview ( Summary)</b><br><br>We took days off, we booked our flights, flew a day before , got in late at night to Accra, then we decided to eat something ( spaghetti and sauce), you see we thought it was familiar, what could be wrong right?.. well here goes, I couldn’t sleep well, I vomited the next morning, hubby was purging... ahh gbese...the devil can’t win naw, after we have come this far...<br><br>Meanwhile our Accra Gang they throway prayer for us, our interview gang too, my May ITA group too, my siblings, my friends.... their prayers were answered o .....<br><br>Interview went amazingly well... lady was nice, hmm... let me rest, would continue later...<br><br><br><i>Cont’d</i><br><br><br>Back to the matter!!<br><br>So we got to the embassy, right on time, they collected all phone, all wristwatches, most things sha, but I still went in with my bag after they searched thoroughly, we dropped our documents with the receptionists and held on to some other supporting docs. We could hear an interview going well, the lady ended up passing and was asked to either come the next day or submit her passports from Lagos. Kai we were happy for her o and gingered ....<br><br>At this time, just hubby and I were at the waiting room, we waited and waited o, they didn’t call us, I even dozed off small, finally after about 1hr 30mins of waiting... I was called, she apologized for the delay, such an amazing lady, she was nice as well... then the questions came o ( another story), highlight was that the interview was almost like a spousal sponsorship interview, i told her the truth, adding interesting information in between, she was just laughing, me sef laugh join...one thing was for sure I made sure all I said was the truth about our relationship, because hubby was next  and our answers at least had to match small.....<br><br><b>The Verdict</b> - Hubby’s turn, she asked almost the same things, it went well o.... then she asked hubby to call me, and then she told us the good news , that we passed , you need to see the way we jumped, then she said in that moment when I told you guys, I could see the love, mehn we beamed even more. She then asked when we were traveling, we said tonight, she said they can only stamp our passports and issue COPR tomorrow or we wait till we get back to lagos, hubby said when we get to lagos ..... sigh<br><br>Hmm, we sha told her thank you and left... I was happy and sad ( left to me , we go reschedule flight and collect our thing sharply next day), but hubby kept saying he had to go back, I cried and cried , kept wondering why he didn’t see the importance the way I did... hmmm... didn’t talk to him o... finally I couldn’t stand to see him feeling so bad, sha told him how I felt and we settled...<br><br>Off to lagos back, Shebi all is well that ends well, next day ppr mail entered, I was so freaking happy, called hubby straight, told my Accra and Interview gang, I sharply carry passport say make I go submit. Got to hubby’s car o, na so stomach pain start again( at this time I knew village people were really trying , but I also knew Allah was stronger than them)... hubby rushed me to the emergency room in the hospital o, took drip, hubby stayed with me for a while... then I went back home as I was cleared...<br><br><b>Then I submitted the next day...</b><br><br><br>I know my story is very long, I even missed out some part , so that people won’t get bored and to conceal my identity lol. This journey was something else...all my friends had gotten , people I put through, I knew the process to a large extent , why my journey was longer, I don’t know but I know Allah knows best ...<br><br>I didn’t call out advices, but I’m sure if you read my story well, you would have picked one or two...oh and if you find out you have an interview with your spouse due to addition or something, don’t be scared , you can also reach out to me...<br><br>I sincerely thank all my friends, my family, my newly made friends from whatsapp support groups, nairaland forum and friends made here.... without the support, I may have given up.<br><br>Now I pray for good health as we must get to our second country InshaAllah...<br><br>It ended in praise .

"<div class=""narrow"">I was so worried that I went back after biometrics although we very few who experienced this change most ppl stay on “IP2” thru out.<blockquote><a href=""/post/75952604""><b>Topsmamen</b></a>:<br>This should be helpful to post-AOR folks.....<br><br>IRCC has introduced a number of changes in recent months and it is time to update our understanding of the post-AOR stages. This is simply built on the amazing work of an individual who developed an explanation of the various stages we can use - informally - to track the progress of our application. Other expert individuals have posited the underlying trends and found evidence for them. <b>In short, the traditional transition from IP1 to IP2 to ghost update to PPR still holds but in a modified way due to these changes.</b><br><br><b>From 31st December 2018</b>, everyone except for Inland candidates has to provide their biometrics which means the default starting stage applicants will see for their Background Check is ‘IP2’ (“We are processing your background check…”), however, this is a<span style=""color:#990000;""><b> ‘False IP2’</b></span>, meaning an IP2 that has appeared before it is actually due as the application has not in fact progressed to the IP2 stage yet.<br><br><b>If you have an AOR of 31st December 2018 or later,</b> follow the chart below to track your progress. <b>Candidates will remain in a state of <span style=""color:#990000;"">'False IP2'</span> throughout their application and only see a series of 'ghost updates' following their MEP;</b> the first such ghost update (which should follow shortly after MEP) will signify your Real IP1, the second ghost update will signify your Real IP2, and the third will be your ‘Final’ Ghost Update, following which you are likely to receive your PPR.<br><br><b>If you have an AOR date of up to 30 Dec 2018,</b> the chart also applies to you if you meet one or more of these conditions: you are a CEC or PNP-Inland candidate, you were required to provide your biometrics or you did not pay your RPRF upfront.<br><br><b>Note for FSW-Outland candidates who have an AOR date of up to 30 Dec 2018:</b> If you did not need to provide biometrics and paid your RPRF upfront, the old transition from NA1 all the way to a Final Ghost Update will still apply to you. Your Background Check should have started in NA1 (""Not Applicable"" 1), meaning your Background Check status said ""Not Applicable"" right after you submitted your application.<br><br><b>Post-submission stages:</b><br><b><span style=""color:#990000;"">False IP2</span></b> - Usually right from AOR or just after MEP. Background Check shows ""We are processing your background check. We will send you a message if we need more information.”<br><b>MEP</b> - Medicals passed: review of medical results changes from ""You do not need a medical exam."" to ""You have passed the medical exam."" There might be no email for MEP.<br><b>Ghost Update</b> - When you log in, the application says it's been ""updated"" but none of the fields have changed. Once you logout and log back in, the application returns to being ""submitted"". Ghost updates are not announced by email and a candidate must check their profile daily to not miss them.<br><b>Ghost Update #1 or <span style=""color:#990000;"">Real IP1</span></b> - ""In progress"" 1: Background Check changes to ""Your application is in progress. We will send you a message when we start your background check."" Usually follows MEP. Some applicants (especially Inland and CEC) skip this stage. You should receive an email for your Real IP1 - the email will not provide any details, just that your application has been updated.<br><b>NA2 </b>- ""Not Applicable"" 2: Background Check changes to ""Not Applicable"" again after IP1. Some applicants skip this stage and it is easily missed.

I'm not exaggerating when I say I probably would not have PPR today without the valuable information obtained here. Now that  the journey is at its end, I feel the need to share my story. Perhaps it would help someone out there. My application is a bit peculiar because my wife got pregnant with our second child sometime in May 2018, so we applied as a family of three with the hope that we would be in Canada by the time the baby is born. As God would have it, progress was slow, baby was born and PPR came a few days later. Instead of sending our passports, we notified IRCC of the change in family composition, provided POF for a family of four and other documents and a second PPR was issued. See timeline below:<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>The lesson here is to not loose hope.

Decided on this journey January 2019. <br><br>Wrote ielts 09 Feb (first attempt)<br><br>LRWS: 8.5, 8.5, 8, 8. Overall band= 8.5. I saw my result and could not believe. I still think maybe it is not mine and they switched results.  <br><br>I am grateful to @Eshay for introducing me to the Cannyland journey, this platform and thread, guiding me and sharing her experiences while I prepared for the exams. You are my angel. May our dreams come true  <img src=""https://www.nairaland.com/faces/kiss.gif"" alt=""kiss"" border=""0"" class=""faces""><br><br>I prepared for a month. <br><br>Listening: Practice and concentration is the key. I practiced at least 3 times a week. First results were poor but over time it got better. Know the scores you need to get an 8 (36/40 minimum) and never give up until you can score it in at least 6-7 practice tests consecutively.  @happyme31 is so right, that listening tip helped me too especially part 2, 3, and 4. I remember it was a lady that scored so high in part 6 that gave that tip. Practice writing out keys parts of the conversation as you hear them, especially for those academic and touring conversations (part 3 and 4). This will be so useful for answers that are synonyms of what was spoken. For instance, in part 3 of my exam, the supervisor told the student that her presentation was too sudden and the answer was Abrupt. She told the student that she was also too slow, too fast in her speaking and the answer was Irregular. Writing out that conversation helped me identify the synonyms as I rechecked. In those sections, where you have A, B, C options, You would waste a lot of time and lose concentration if you are looking for the answers while the conversation is on. Write out key words and points. Part 1 and sometimes part 2 are straightforward, no need to write all, just listen carefully. If you miss an answer, MOVE ON FAST, don't panic or think about it.  <br><br>Reading: Skimming and scanning are the keys. The answers are sequential through the passage but they can be tricky. In passage 3 of my exam, the last two answers were in the second paragraph because it mentioned two sentences about outdoor jobs, while the rest of the paragraphs were about indoor jobs. When you cannot find the answer, move on immediately and finish the rest, then return to those unknown questions and read the passages carefully sentence by sentence in that paragraph you think it is, you will find it, depending on how much time you have. While practicing, I noticed my weakness was the difference between False and Not Given, so I spent more time on those parts.<br><br>Speaking: Telling a story in part 2 and talkativeness in all the parts are the keys. As @happyme31 pointed out, Jay's videos are the best. I also watched past interviews of band 9 candidates and asked myself why they were deserving of band 9. They never stopped talking and used the right vocabulary for the topic. Talk so much and allow the examiner to get tired and stop you (Be a talkative on that day, even if you are not naturally one). It does not matter if you have no idea. If you are unlucky like me to be asked about tough topics like Global Trade, importation and exportation between countries and sustainability in businesses in part 3, still say anything. I paused and told the examiner that this was a tough question because economics is not my strength but I will answer it anyhow based on my layman's knowledge. I used the example of computer village, Nigeria's population and our hustling spirit as the country's best export. I knew I did not make sense but I was determined to keep talking. I just kept thinking of President Trump who says rubbish with so much confidence and still gets supporters, lol. <br><br>Writing: Structure and complex sentences are the keys. Just like @happyme31 said, Jay's video was my only guide. Please use the first 2 minutes to understand the question and what is required. Then use the next three minutes to draw an outline in your question paper of points you want to write. May a sketchy outline so you do not get stuck in the middle of your writing especially for Task 2.  Practice using different kinds of sentences (passive, complex, compound questions, etc. Avoid writing in simple sentences). Also, use transitional words like your life depends on them (However, even though, although, yet, still, nevertheless, etc). Use uncommon words as long as they make sense (critics, cousine, turbulence, flabbergasted, etc, write like those  village headmasters of those days who use big grammars that make sense). Also keep writing, do not stop, collect extra sheet (you can only do this if you have drawn an outline of your ideas). <br><br>For task 2, fill at most three pages or three and a half. Structure is everything in task two, there is a template for writing from Jay's video (introduction, four to five paragraphs for body and elaborate on your ideas, then conclusion). Elaborate on each point in each paragraph (use examples, quote researches and studies (whether they are true or not, the examiner does not care about whether that research really exists), use your personal experiences as a student, worker, mother, father, Nigerian, hustler, business man anything). As you write, imagine you are a debater in the room trying to convince, expantiate, elaborate or prove to your listener about points. Finally, don't be like me, please proofread, allocate the last five minutes to proof read and edit all your tasks. I think I was only fortunate that I write error-free sentences on first draft, but maybe if I had edited, I would have scored higher (maybe, or maybe I scored lower but God touched the examiner's heart). Editing helps and might improve your score by .5 which might make a big difference. <br><br>Most importantly, avoid over-confidence. This exam is about technique and strategy, not English knowledge. I am at the level of a native speaker and very advanced user in my profession but I practiced like it was German or Chinese I was preparing for.  And after writing the exams, pray, pray, pray to any God you believe in. <br><br>Apologies for the long post but I just wanted to help like previous posters in part 6 have helped me too.<br><br>ECA is in the final evaluation stage with Wes. Once it comes, I will dive into the pool. I am currently gathering post-ITA docs because my CRS score is really high (thanks to IELTS scores) as our seniors here have advised potential CRS high scorers. <br><br><br>Fingers crossed for us all in every stage of our journeys.

"<div class=""narrow"">Congrats dear, i'm hoping to score this high too in my second attempt, so help me God<blockquote><a href=""/post/75990922""><b>ladymarshall</b></a>:<br>Silent reader but not anymore, lol. Decided on this journey January 2019. <br><br>Wrote ielts 09 Feb (first attempt)<br><br>LRWS: 8.5, 8.5, 8, 8. Overall band= 8.5. I saw my result and could not believe. I still think maybe it is not mine and they switched results.  <br><br>I am grateful to @Eshay for introducing me to the Cannyland journey, this platform and thread, guiding me and sharing her experiences while I prepared for the exams. You are my angel. May our dreams come true  <img src=""https://www.nairaland.com/faces/kiss.gif"" alt=""kiss"" border=""0"" class=""faces""><br><br>I prepared for a month. <br><br>Listening: Practice and concentration is the key. I practiced at least 3 times a week. First results were poor but over time it got better. Know the scores you need to get an 8 (36/40 minimum) and never give up until you can score it in at least 6-7 practice tests consecutively.  @happyme31 is so right, that listening tip helped me too especially part 2, 3, and 4. I remember it was a lady that scored so high in part 6 that gave that tip. Practice writing out keys parts of the conversation as you hear them, especially for those academic and touring conversations (part 3 and 4). This will be so useful for answers that are synonyms of what was spoken. For instance, in part 3 of my exam, the supervisor told the student that her presentation was too sudden and the answer was Abrupt. She told the student that she was also too slow, too fast in her speaking and the answer was Irregular. Writing out that conversation helped me identify the synonyms as I rechecked. In those sections, where you have A, B, C options, You would waste a lot of time and lose concentration if you are looking for the answers while the conversation is on. Write out key words and points. Part 1 and sometimes part 2 are straightforward, no need to write all, just listen carefully. If you miss an answer, MOVE ON FAST, don't panic or think about it.  <br><br>Reading: Skimming and scanning are the keys. The answers are sequential through the passage but they can be tricky. In passage 3 of my exam, the last two answers were in the second paragraph because it mentioned two sentences about outdoor jobs, while the rest of the paragraphs were about indoor jobs. When you cannot find the answer, move on immediately and finish the rest, then return to those unknown questions and read the passages carefully sentence by sentence in that paragraph you think it is, you will find it, depending on how much time you have. While practicing, I noticed my weakness was the difference between False and Not Given, so I spent more time on those parts.<br><br>Speaking: Telling a story in part 2 and talkativeness in all the parts are the keys. As @happyme31 pointed out, Jay's videos are the best. I also watched past interviews of band 9 candidates and asked myself why they were deserving of band 9. They never stopped talking and used the right vocabulary for the topic. Talk so much and allow the examiner to get tired and stop you (Be a talkative on that day, even if you are not naturally one). It does not matter if you have no idea. If you are unlucky like me to be asked about tough topics like Global Trade, importation and exportation between countries and sustainability in businesses in part 3, still say anything. I paused and told the examiner that this was a tough question because economics is not my strength but I will answer it anyhow based on my layman's knowledge. I used the example of computer village, Nigeria's population and our hustling spirit as the country's best export. I knew I did not make sense but I was determined to keep talking. I just kept thinking of President Trump who says rubbish with so much confidence and still gets supporters, lol. <br><br>Writing: Structure and complex sentences are the keys. Just like @happyme31 said, Jay's video was my only guide. Please use the first 2 minutes to understand the question and what is required. Then use the next three minutes to draw an outline in your question paper of points you want to write. May a sketchy outline so you do not get stuck in the middle of your writing especially for Task 2.  Practice using different kinds of sentences (passive, complex, compound questions, etc. Avoid writing in simple sentences). Also, use transitional words like your life depends on them (However, even though, although, yet, still, nevertheless, etc). Use uncommon words as long as they make sense (critics, cousine, turbulence, flabbergasted, etc, write like those  village headmasters of those days who use big grammars that make sense). Also keep writing, do not stop, collect extra sheet (you can only do this if you have drawn an outline of your ideas). <br><br>For task 2, fill at most three pages or three and a half. Structure is everything in task two, there is a template for writing from Jay's video (introduction, four to five paragraphs for body and elaborate on your ideas, then conclusion). Elaborate on each point in each paragraph (use examples, quote researches and studies (whether they are true or not, the examiner does not care about whether that research really exists), use your personal experiences as a student, worker, mother, father, Nigerian, hustler, business man anything). As you write, imagine you are a debater in the room trying to convince, expantiate, elaborate or prove to your listener about points. Finally, don't be like me, please proofread, allocate the last five minutes to proof read and edit all your tasks. I think I was only fortunate that I write error-free sentences on first draft, but maybe if I had edited, I would have scored higher (maybe, or maybe I scored lower but God touched the examiner's heart).

It’s been a journey of immense patience. I had typed out my PPR story in faith in September 2018 when I submitted my eAPR and prayed.<br><br>This is my timeline below- <br><br>WES Evaluation for my Masters - 24/05/2018<br><br>IELTS with British Council, Lagos - 28/07/2018<br>LRSW - 8.5/8/8/6.5 (1st attempt)<br>(Paid for EOR/remark on 10/07/2018)<br>Writing upgraded to ‘7’ on 31/08/2018 (After praying and fasting tremendously for 7 days.

Oct 18, 2018<br>Biometrics done… Oct 19, 2018<br>Ordered GCMS… Nov 2nd 2018 (Got it 34 days later with info saying that info sharing had started with other embassies.)<br>ADR &amp; Interview… None<br>No Ghost update.<br>PPR...... Feb 19, 2019<br><br><b>Timeline - 151 days</b><br><br>(Single applicant) <br><br>I also fired plenty prayers and fasted and kept trusting GOD that I wanted a PPR testimony and HE did it! It has ended in PRAISE! I prayed for a speedy PPR but GOD does things in HIS own best time so I am more than joyous 5 months later!<br><br>The first two months after submitting my application was the hardest for me because I was checking my application <b>at least 3 times a day</b> waiting to see any change. Lmao I was like a crazy person. After the second month and nothing, I decided to just continue my life and started checking from 3 times daily to once a week to once a month. I had seen people write here that at first they go crazy logging in every time then after they just relax and forget about it till PPR comes.<br><br>ECA - I used WES to evaluate my UK masters. It took 1 month and that was the first thing I did after I made my decision to start this journey in April 2018.<br><br>POF - I submitted only my Stanbic Mutual Funds letter and mutual funds statement for POF. I didn’t submit my bank statements. In the mutual funds letter, they wrote my funds in Naira and also wrote a Canadian equivalent of my funds in Canadian Dollars (using the rate as at the day the letter was printed and they indicated that also). I did not submit my bank statement or pay slips. <br><br>Work experience - Over 5 years experience. My former employer didn’t have any issue drafting the letter in IRCC format while my present employer drafted the letter thinking I needed it for visiting visa purposes in the format I wanted. <br><br>Medicals - Everything was fine. Thank GOD.<br><br>Travel History - Over the Span of 10 years, I had travelled numerous times to 8 countries multiple times etc <br><br>Biometrics -  <b>One important issue to note was that I had a technical difficulty with my online application profile in respect to Biometrics.</b> I did my biometrics a day after getting the BIL and even though my profile was updated a few days later with my biometrics details, Biometrics never showed as completed for me and even after 30 days had lapsed on the issue, biometrics status changed to ‘We have not received your fingerprints. Check your biometrics request message below’ and so I worried alot because I felt this might somehow slow down my application if it was showing that my biometrics was yet to be done. I raised 3 CSEs to complain about the issue and was told the biometrics details had been received by the responsible office so I decided to just relax and go about my life till my PPR arrived. I never got a ghost update before my PPR. However when I logged into my profile after I had received it, I saw that my biometrics had changed to ‘Completed’.<br><br><b>No siblings in Canada. </b><br><br><b>Also two visa refusals in my history.

I did some research and then decided I think I want this, an amazing life for me and my kids. I told my baby ( my then bf , now hubby).. he wasn’t interested then o, said you can make it in naija, kinikan kinikan , hmmm . I tried to convince him then, I just said let me start first . Started my WES October 2017, wrote my ielts a month after( passed in one sitting).<br><br><b>WES</b> - Then I mistakenly or just mumuly decided to use nipost for WES just to buy time , maybe baby would agree, that’s how my village people caught up to me o and strike started . The up and down ehn , sorting people , spending money, Wes finally came through. <br><br><b>Work experience/CRS score</b> - Then the wait for 3 years experience nko as I just wanted to use one workplace to claim points. Finally it was complete, then another wait for crs to drop to 441... oh I forgot, Passport expired in between all of the above (after ielts though)<br><br><b>Passport matter</b> - Then the debate to wait and do court with change of name or just renew like that, by this time baby was already feeling the Canadian waka small small , he had gotten his Internationàl passport, even did ielts, he passed,but his score wasn’t up to mine(maxing out the ielts score )...<br><br><b>Single Or As a Couple</b> ? - Back to me doing this alone at first. So I said babe let’s do court na and apply as a couple, baby was like no o, everything is a process, I must propose, then do intro, then court can follow, I said babe hmm adding spouse in between is one kind o. But I can’t propose to my self abi or do court with myself, i sha continued.<br><br><b>ITA</b> - Well, ITA showed up,  I didn’t have issues with POF ( used First bank treasury bills, stanbic fixed deposit , stanbic money market investment funds), Alhamdulillah... I sha chilled till July, so I can add my love in between, so it won’t be too early .<br><br><b>AOR</b> - Hence my AOR July 1st, then the race began, constant profile checking, oh lest I forget , before this I met amazing people in our May ITA group , TEECAN , my brother Threemg(love you bro ), my sissy deesmama(AOR mate) and now close friend, we’re plenty small in that group and I hope our prayers would all be answered soonest.<br><br>I forgot to mention, baby proposed before I even got ITA, then we did a huge introduction ceremony and a small court wedding ceremony , all this while , my file was at Ottawa . Now it was time to add my hubby. Sent a mail, i got ADR, too many requests o, but we did it sha and submitted... they added my baby beginning of October or so..then I got IP2 some days after, Alhamdulillah, was so happy I buzzed deesmama straight that she should check her profile , she didn’t get that day, but got the next day and ppr the Monday afterwards... amazing period <br><br><b>The Wait</b> - Then the wait started, where’s ppr nah, everyone was getting ppr up and down , but the thing didn’t reach me... hmmm...called an agent , the guy was super rude , was just using me to catch cruise...<br>I called like 2 weeks after again then I heard the dreaded news, file was at Accra, I cried ehn, didn’t believe my ears, I told my bro straight @threemg, he said I should not worry, meanwhile I ordered gcms notes, as the first one refused to come (ended up getting here later)...when it finally came all was passed but a section called « other Reqs » showed not started, the type of check was non compliance check, mogbe.. I researched, checked canada visa forum, nothing, my worry was now in full force...<br><br><b>Accra VO gang</b> - Then I joined the Accra VO gang, I’m glad now that Accra VO is performing, there are rumors that they have a processing window of January till March, you might see a lot of PPRs from Accra this period.... I pray they extend this their window so at least they can attend to all, please release my people Abeg... . I Met a couple of friends and caring people in the group,I thought I was going to be depressed in the group, but the support was reassuring....anyways by this time I didn’t check nairaland again before I enter depression things.. @threemg added me to the group, then we all started surviving together...<br><br><b>Interview things</b> - Fast forward to January 14th, request for interview , both me and spouse had to attend, we also had to come with all evidence of our relationship from the onset and they gave us just 2 weeks to prepare.. Ahhhh gbese, called hubby straight , called my bro @threemg... and as you’ve already guessed, I cried ehn, tears couldn’t stop flowing, so many regrets, but I never regretted ever adding my baby, most of the regrets was all around maybe waiting till IP2 or after PPr or adding more documents or something sha..<br><br><i>I must say this, I’m quite pessimistic as well, that didn’t help me in this journey at all...please let’s be optimistic in this journey o, very important Abeg.</i><br><br>My story is long abi, hmm it hasn’t finished o, keep reading...<br><br><br><b>Interview Prep</b>- The documents gathering started, you know this modern day love na soft copies of pictures dey our phone, we used over 20k to print 200pictures... I went to airtel office for phone records between hubby and I, those ones used me to catch cruise too, said they could only give me 3 months worth of records, as a naija girl, i also applied at another office, so I could maybe get 6 months altogether, they caught me sha o ( but I still found a way out)... I took screenshots of our iMessage chats, we exported whatsapp chat, we printed hotel receipts of all our escapades, we printed pictures of gifts we ever gave each other that we snapped, what didn’t we get...hmm<br><br><br><b>The Interview ( Summary)</b><br><br>We took days off, we booked our flights, flew a day before , got in late at night to Accra, then we decided to eat something ( spaghetti and sauce), you see we thought it was familiar, what could be wrong right?.. well here goes, I couldn’t sleep well, I vomited the next morning, hubby was purging... ahh gbese...the devil can’t win naw, after we have come this far...<br><br>Meanwhile our Accra Gang they throway prayer for us, our interview gang too, my May ITA group too, my siblings, my friends.... their prayers were answered o .....<br><br>Interview went amazingly well... lady was nice, hmm... let me rest, would continue later...<br><br><br><i>Cont’d</i><br><br><br>Back to the matter!!<br><br>So we got to the embassy, right on time, they collected all phone, all wristwatches, most things sha, but I still went in with my bag after they searched thoroughly, we dropped our documents with the receptionists and held on to some other supporting docs. We could hear an interview going well, the lady ended up passing and was asked to either come the next day or submit her passports from Lagos. Kai we were happy for her o and gingered ....<br><br>At this time, just hubby and I were at the waiting room, we waited and waited o, they didn’t call us, I even dozed off small, finally after about 1hr 30mins of waiting... I was called, she apologized for the delay, such an amazing lady, she was nice as well... then the questions came o ( another story), highlight was that the interview was almost like a spousal sponsorship interview, i told her the truth, adding interesting information in between, she was just laughing, me sef laugh join...one thing was for sure I made sure all I said was the truth about our relationship, because hubby was next  and our answers at least had to match small.....<br><br><b>The Verdict</b> - Hubby’s turn, she asked almost the same things, it went well o.... then she asked hubby to call me, and then she told us the good news , that we passed , you need to see the way we jumped, then she said in that moment when I told you guys, I could see the love, mehn we beamed even more. She then asked when we were traveling, we said tonight, she said they can only stamp our passports and issue COPR tomorrow or we wait till we get back to lagos, hubby said when we get to lagos ..... sigh<br><br>Hmm, we sha told her thank you and left... I was happy and sad ( left to me , we go reschedule flight and collect our thing sharply next day), but hubby kept saying he had to go back, I cried and cried , kept wondering why he didn’t see the importance the way I did... hmmm... didn’t talk to him o... finally I couldn’t stand to see him feeling so bad, sha told him how I felt and we settled...<br><br>Off to lagos back, Shebi all is well that ends well, next day ppr mail entered, I was so freaking happy, called hubby straight, told my Accra and Interview gang, I sharply carry passport say make I go submit. Got to hubby’s car o, na so stomach pain start again( at this time I knew village people were really trying , but I also knew Allah was stronger than them)... hubby rushed me to the emergency room in the hospital o, took drip, hubby stayed with me for a while... then I went back home as I was cleared...<br><br><b>Then I submitted the next day...</b><br><br><br>I know my story is very long, I even missed out some part , so that people won’t get bored and to conceal my identity lol. This journey was something else...all my friends had gotten , people I put through, I knew the process to a large extent , why my journey was longer, I don’t know but I know Allah knows best ...<br><br>I didn’t call out advices, but I’m sure if you read my story well, you would have picked one or two...oh and if you find out you have an interview with your spouse due to addition or something, don’t be scared , you can also reach out to me...<br><br>I sincerely thank all my friends, my family, my newly made friends from whatsapp support groups, nairaland forum and friends made here.... without the support, I may have given up.<br><br>Now I pray for good health as we must get to our second country InshaAllah...<br><br>It ended in praise . Alhamdulillah!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br><br></blockquote><br><br><br><br><br>is it compulsory that there would be an interview when adding spouse</div>",4:47pm,Feb-26,2019

Every single penny spent was counted mehn. I was the research master, looking round every nook and cranny for how to save. In fact, the first step I took to determine if this Canny thing was feasible was to create an excel sheet, draw up a full budget, create saving goals and determine if and how income would meet up with expenditure, etc. Then my goal throughout was to spend less than I budgeted (and I was mostly successful in this). This is my story of how I did things the alaroro way.<br><br>1.	<b>ECA</b>. Evaluated for only myself, only my (foreign) masters. Tomorrow will take care of itself for hubby’s ECA . Used WES, regular postage to a friend in Canada, and made sure I claimed my HST refund (no longer possible/necessary). <br>2.	<b>IELTS</b>. Prayed like never before, prepared like I never have, took this exam so serious. Why? Could not really afford to write twice lol. Note that I practically read and write for a living so could have been smug, but desperation is real and works. To God be the glory I maxed out in one attempt and shared a testimonious testimony here <br>3.	<b>POF</b>. This was a very big challenge, we had absolutely no hope as at when we got ITA, but family pulled through in a way I never expected. 100% gift deed from a close family member, bank transfer in USD. Bank statement showing transfers (had to be broken in two cos of money laundering rules), gift deed signed by donor and I and notarised by a supreme court-listed notary public, Bank of Canada exchange rates USD/CAD for the date, bank reference letter in IRCC format and letter on non-indebtedness (account still in my maiden name).<br>4.	<b>Reference letters</b> in IRCC format from the two places of employment I claimed points for. Every other thing was in personal history. Payslips for all the months in question except the last three months rpior to submission, and I included LOE on the omission and bank statement showing inflow for those three months.<br>5.	<b>Proof of family member</b>. My relative was happy (in fact, excited) to give me copies of her ID and proof of residence. Sent me 2 different IDs and different utility bills, insisted I do overkill and use all lol. Used her birth certificate, my dad’s and mine to prove relationship. Did LOE that X(Y)Z is my father’s sister and therefore my paternal aunt (bracket because her name has funkified from what was on birth certificate)’<br>6.	<b>Change of name</b>. affidavit, newspaper and marriage certificate.<br>7.	LOE that <b>open university</b> is part time/distance learning and I’ve been working fulltime while looking for their MBA.<br>8.	<b>PCC</b>. Abuja HQ. Very painfully parted with 20k for spouse and I. It was indeed very painful. Foreign PCC was a breeze and was mailed to a friend in Canada. I requested it same period I registered for IELTS and ECA.<br>9.	<b>ADR</b>. One of my certificates was undated. Apparently it has been undated since eternity and nobody every noticed. I got an ADR for this and you can imagine my fright. I had to send the certificate back to source for them to date and stamp it, write me a letter of explanation. So I sent the dated cert, guilt letter from institution to IRCC. Naim I receive another ADR instantly for dated cert.. just jejely sent only the dated cert. No accompanying explanations.<br>10.	<b>GCMS</b>. Used GCMS buddy, got my notes in 35 days. Was very relieved to see that the dated certificate had been accepted, and my PVO was Ottawa. Saw that my CRS was reduced by 5 points post AOR even though my birthday was post ITA.<br><hr><br><br>My story<br>Any Catholics here? You must love this song: <br>When I remember, what you’ve done for me, my heart fills with joy for there’s none like you.. there was a time in life when I thought all was lost Lord I am a living testimony of your love… I will tell this story to my neighbours I will tell this story to all my friends… and so, I will give you all I have… for always Lord, you know, that I have given all I have. <br><i>(insert edit: so along the way my testimony song changed to this one: … I am never in a hurry, I will wait upon the Lord, he will answer my prayer, when the time comes… Omnipotent reigneth, my redeemer liveth, he will answer my prayer, when the time comes)</i><br><br>It all began in October 2017. My best friend relocated to the Canada. Now I have three best friends, so it was alright.<br>Fast-forward to January 2018. Another best friend called me and started preaching the Canada gospel. I said mba, for this Nigeria, I was made. For this Nigeria, I go succeed. Where will I even get money for such from? Na so my bestie start her own. She sha sent me nairaland link and told me that I can use pension.<br><br>I cameth here and readeth stories and testimonies. It is this easy? Did my overnight stint. Calculated my score. Read IRCCs  version of the story. Discovered that I can’t use pension, but there is something called gift deed. Made a deal with canada bestie, migrating bestie, and God: if my contract is renewed permanently, naija I stay. If contract renewed for one year, abroad I go (I really love my job and may never get anything similar to do in the abroad).<br><br>Contract was renewed for only one year. Jokingly mentioned Canada to the husband. Husband reminded me that he was born to live in the Canada, and that I was the ‘we will make it in Nigeria’ proponent. I thought long and hard. If we cannot relocate at our young ages, when we go fit? Opportunity no dey knock plenty times o! Informed my family that we are moving to the Canada and started preaching the gospel to my siblings. I shall never stay in the cold alone. <br><br>Was planning to take everything slowly, e.g ielts with January salary, WES with February salary, etc. No hurry in life. Then life happened. We had a mini family disaster and my entire outlook on life changed. I can say that my spouse and I became adults. We spent a couple of weeks at home recovering, and in the anger stage of my grief, I lashed out by aggressively tackling this whole EE matter. Borrowed funds from somewhere, paid for ielts, wes, started checking out jobs in the Canada, etc. Also started my ielts preparation with a vengeance. At that point I needed to be sure that Nigeria wouldn’t be one of my future problems.<br><br><i>(Lest I forget, at this stage 3rd bestie called me. She’s getting married and relocating to the Canada as future spouse is a PR. Kilode? I will wake up one day and it’s only me that will be in the Nigeria? No, never. I toldeth her that I’m also on my way to the Canny)</i><br><br>ITA came finally. We sha chilled, because no iota of POF. Took our time with medicals and documentation. Took advantage of a time when most of my bosses were out to get reference letter from the most discrete of them all. Paid a courtesy visit to my previous employer, and one week after requested a reference from them. Spoke with my aunt in Canada, her enthusiasm gingered mine and she sent her docs. Small small sha. One day I got the call that POF was ready and I swung into action to get the bank docs, especially letter in IRCC format. It was pure hell (dealing with the banks). But we finally overcame <br><br>Oya now… AOR. We scan every, fill every. By the way, I had like 14 addresses in my address history (I’m a nomad). My travel history was also more than 10. But I filled in my personal history very religiously, left nothing whatsoever out (I can’t shout). I used Facebook, my emails, everything to crosscheck that information was accurate. Only uploaded current passport data page and stamped pages even though most of the history was in old passport.<br><br>And then the long wait. Fear that I’ll go to London because of ADR. Joy that I was in Ottawa. Apprehension that I can  be moved to London or Accra at any time. Dread that I’ll get stuck in security due to the nature of my job. Always on this thread so productivity at work dropped.<br><br>And so on, and so forth (actually at this point I’m just simply tired of typing).<br><hr><br><br>Continues today 27/02/2019<br><br>Na so the wait continue after I don type PPR story complete, it was raining on June applicants when I typed my story. Those days ehn, you’ll get IP2 today, ghost tomorrow, PPR next tomorrow. But was that your sister’s case? For where! Silence laik this.<br><br>I believe I called IRCC sometime in November. Confirmed that file was still in Ottawa so relieved, but didn’t know the right questions to ask e.g what is status of eligibility, criminality and security.<br><br>December there was another rain. Did it touch your sister? Nooooooo.<br><br>Dec 30 = 6 months. No show. I raised CSE in January, called IRCC, mailed Ottawa. Generic responses from mails but got to learn that Eligibility, Criminality are passed. Security not started. File still in Ottawa. People who contacted Ralph in their second months, the ones who made him unavailable to the agbayas like us started dropping PPR stories. That thing can vex me ehn <img src=""https://www.nairaland.com/faces/cheesy.png"" alt=""cheesy"" border=""0"" class=""faces"">. Another thing that vex me is one day that someone sent me a PM and was complaining that she’s tired of waiting, since September fah. To me that was plain insensitive. Madam did not even bother to ask me that how’s my own wait going.<br><br>Anyway that’s by the way. Apart from those my mood was generally okay but I was royally pis.sed at the inability to plan. Ordered GCMS notes, still on their way. Will be very interesting to see what delayed my application.<br><br>Fast-forward to Monday. I saw a ghost. Normally ghost in Ottawa morning means PPR in Ottawa night so I got excited and braced for the night. Basically did not sleep, but was up checking for mail. Did the mail come? For where… <br><br>So I came up with a theory: my ghost means file has gone to Accra or for security lol. Time to start living my life. Relegate Canada to plan B. Paid my NOUN fees, make I complete this semester at least. Basically rerouted my annual plan in my head since I assumed the Canada is not God’s will for me this year. We shall go to the Cannyland next year. In short, what’s so special about the Cannyland?<br><br>This morning I woke up very early and sober, remembered that second bestie is leaving this week and I won’t see her for at least a year since I’m not moving again this year. Then became even more sober and emotional. Was a terrible morning but at least the bad mood ensured I was early to work. On my way to work, daily devotion was ‘do not be anxious about anything… and the peace of God which surpasses all understanding… It was so fantastic and perfect. I totally calmed down and was at peace with my decision (or compulsion?) to remain in Nigeria. All this while my data had been turned off, I hadn’t checked my mail since around 4am.<br><br>I got to the office and wifi connected while I was in the lobby. I had three mails. Every morning I get two mails for sure: skyscanner alert, and birthday alarm. So when I saw 3 in the notification bar it piqued my interest. I opened my mail app.<br><br>And saw the beautiful, darling, Ready for Visa/Pret pour visa sitting there. O glory! (seriously guys just give a wiper anywhere you are <img src=""https://www.nairaland.com/faces/cheesy.png"" alt=""cheesy"" border=""0"" class=""faces""> <img src=""https://www.nairaland.com/faces/cheesy.png"" alt=""cheesy"" border=""0"" class=""faces""> <img src=""https://www.nairaland.com/faces/cheesy.png"" alt=""cheesy"" border=""0"" class=""faces""> )<br><hr><br><br>Sincerely, I’m not excited. But I am sooooo grateful, and I feel so humbled, and at the same time scared that something can still go wrong. Las las God is God, and there is none else.<br><br>8 months wait is not beans and I doff my hat to all still waiting at different stages of this process. May your own story be one of speed. If it has been slow so far, may it change to a speedy tale. <br><br>One advice to pre-AORers, please when filling your application just be honest. The best thing about my wait was that I knew I had been as transparent as possible. There was nothing new for them to unearth, no hidden skeletons. That awareness set me free of anxiety.<br><br>Again, thank you to every member of this e-family. This place is the greatest. You guys are all so responsive! Whenever someone I know encounters a hitch, I be like wait 2 moments, my nairaland fam will fix this. God bless you all. I appreciate again and again those who take out their time to research, collate and put out information. My special shout out goes to Jholarharde and Bammy2017. As private and impersonal as TJ can be you guys didn’t give up on me lol. Thanks a lot for checking up on me this last week, you guys did not know about my ghost disappointment but just happened to encourage me at the best time ever.

"<div class=""narrow""><blockquote><a href=""/post/76164221""><b>BugaDidi</b></a>:<br>Good evening everyone, I am a new member here. Though I understand about this process to some certain aspect I’d just want to ask the able house questions I need clarity on so I’m more informed. I’m applying as a principal applicant a pharmacist and I have 3years work experience, the secondary applicant has masters and more working experience. I’d like to know if it’s compulsory my partner takes the IELtS exams too. I know it boost scores but is it necessary please. Then the second question is for my sister, she just started the process toobut she’s about to get married and she started filling in as a Single applicant. What happens in her case? <br>Thanks.</blockquote><br>You really need to depend on a CRS calculator, if you can score high enough without your spouse taking IELTS, then that's fine. <br>A good practice is to do CRS simulations for different scenario and see which work best for you. Your pharmacy degree will score you same points as a Master degree. Age becomes a strong factor if your proposed primary applicant is above 30years. Work experience of 3 years and above in a skilled job (A,B,0) will score you the highest point in that area.<br><br>As for your other question if adding the spouse later can make her CRS drop below her expected benchmark, or if she's not hopeful or prepared to take visa interviews later on,  then she should withdraw her profile and make a new one after her wedding. <br><br>These are my thoughts, other seniors may help you.

After inputting my data in the crs calculator,  i got an ineligible message. <br><br>Now my moms cousin who is a citizen advised i can use her to claim family points as my aunty. Immediately i put that i was eligible because of the family tie. My CRS then boosted to 395, which is till very low from the trend. <br><br>Now my question is do i rewrite IELTS or go ahead and pray for a PNP nomination. ALso those who were PNP nominated how did you go about it because i see people writing this Exam so many times and it seems a stumbling block.

"<div class=""narrow"">Thank you so much.<br>And yes I tried a CRS calculator and I had a CrS score of close to 455 with 8.5 7.5 7.5 7 LRSW<br><blockquote><a href=""/post/76172279""><b>Pharmola</b></a>:<br><br><br>You really need to depend on a CRS calculator, if you can score high enough without your spouse taking IELTS, then that's fine. <br>A good practice is to do CRS simulations for different scenario and see which work best for you. Your pharmacy degree will score you same points as a Master degree. Age becomes a strong factor if your proposed primary applicant is above 30years. Work experience of 3 years and above in a skilled job (A,B,0) will score you the highest point in that area.<br><br>As for your other question if adding the spouse later can make her CRS drop below her expected benchmark, or if she's not hopeful or prepared to take visa interviews later on,  then she should withdraw her profile and make a new one after her wedding. <br><br>These are my thoughts, other seniors may help you.

I was of the belief that one day naija go better I even used to discourage people that talk about relocating. I had a colleague at work and he was always reading for ielts that was as far back as 2015 and I asked him why he was studying and he said no hope for us in this country that he wants to go to Canada he even explained the process to me that we should do it together I told him forget I am not going anywhere. I even remember abusing him that he should not worry he will come later and be asking me for contracts when I become boss. Not until I had a terrible accident and almost lost my life I spent three months in the hospital with one week in ICU . It was a terrible time for me and my family cos it came unexpected. While I was in d hospital I started reminiscing what next after this then I remembered my friend that told me about Canada years ago he was already there chilling and I said chai see my life only if I listened to this guy, I decided on the spot that if God can see me through and I leave this hospital I must do this Canadian PR. As soon as I left the hospital I called him and he gave me a summary of the process then i decided to do my own research and I stumbled on this thread. Wrote my first ielts a month after I left the hospital I had not even recovered but I was desperate to leave the country so would do what it takes. I remember during the ielts exam people were just staring at me that see this sick person coming to write exams but I was determined. Result came out and I had lrws 6.5,8,7,7.5.  meanwhile I started the wes process it was farely straightforward as I have a foreign degree so no stress. That ielts reslt humbled me because I have never failed an exam I was so down but my family members encouraged me and said with this your condition you still did well but I was already discouraged. I even told  my wife I was no longer interested again all because I could not just come to the fact that I must re write the exams. She said nothing like that ohh she was not interested in the process initially I was the one that convinced her now I want to back out and she said not even considering money spent on wes for both of us and ielts. You know how convincing women can be but thank God I listened. I had to travel abroad for treatment so I told her when I return and in a better state of mind I will write it. A year after the first ielts I registered for the second and I booked it less than three weeks to the actual exam date lo and behold did well in the second ielts.<br><br>Created EE profile immediately I got the result and then dived straight into the pool not too long after ITA came and then we started gathering all documents.<br><br>POF : I used T-bills that covered the entire POF then added buffer with my account statement cos I did not know what  exchange rate will be used. Got tbills certificate and then letter from my bank in ircc format also added six months statement of account<br><br>Work reference: also that was easy for me to get in IRCC format I included my employment letter and my boss complimentary card<br>I sent in my application and got AOR on 23/10/2018. I remember after I submitted I read on this thread that we had to include our ielts test result sheet but I did not. I became jittery but then I just prayed about it that God should favour me and yes He did.<br><br>The wait for mep/bil started then it came a month after aor. I could not do my biometrics on time because I had to go on a work trip and my passport was with the embassy, it was taking longer than usual, my village people wanted to show themselves this is a country that the visa does not take time but mine took unusually long. After over a month of waiting for what usually takes two weeks it finally came and went to do the biometrics the day after I got my passport back. <br><br>Then the wait began I started becoming anxious but then God just reminded me that there are people who have waited beyond the six months and nothing still, I just kept on praying  but then the human factor must surely set in.<br><br>Finally on 22nd feb I saw ghost update that was on Friday evening I called my wife  and told her that next week we will get this ppr and surely God did it, came on Monday 25th and ended in praise.<br><br>I want to thank people on this forum because you guys rock, words cannot be used to show my appreciation to those that started this thread. <br><br>For those already in the process I pray it ends in praise for you all and for those that are yet to start this thread should be your manual cos there in nothing about this journey that you would not find here. <br><br>Even though I am a silent follower of this thread but then I am here to offer assistance to those in need of guidance on the whole process.<br><br>Above all don’t forget God in this journey pray hard if you can fast make sure you do because God is able to do more than what we desire.</div>",8:51pm,Feb-27,2019

I sat for IELTS twice in 2016 but couldn’t ace it. Did another one in 2018 but same no ni. My wife also sat for one in 2016 but didn’t ace it too. We didn’t really bother because she isn’t the PA. After my 3rd attempt, I decided to take a chill pill and more so, cash no too dey like that. My folks tried to ginger me but I resisted and was just chilling. The major thing that got me demotivated in writing another exam is the fact there’s no POF yet (for a family of 3).

So I did her resume in a Canadian format, prepared a cover letter and began to look for jobs so that we can use the job offer to apply for PR through AIPP. Aside from the fact that AIPP only requires a CLB of 4, the POF for a family of 3 is very low ($4847) compared to that of EE ($19k+). As person wey no get POF na, we believe we could hustle for AIPP’s.  <br><br>In the course of searching for jobs upandan, we remembered that her IELTS result had expired since July 2018, hence she needed to write another asap but money no dey. For January wey cashflow dey get as e dey be, I gaz hustle for some bar, a female friend wey we dey this quest together sef gimme some cash. Babe, thank you jare.

This was some 7 months before the introduction of the Express Entry System. I quickly joined in preparing for IELTS and was excited about the possibility of immigrating though I had always believed in living in Nigeria and just visiting other countries for exposure and relaxation. My excitement was cut short by my hubby when I told him about it and he said I could go ahead with the process but that he was not going to write any exam and he would gladly visit us from time to time. I tried to convince him but to no avail so I let it go. My only regret was that I didn’t carry out any research about the process and thought that I couldn’t meet the requirements without my husband writing the IELTS test based on the information I got from people.<br><br>One day in the first quarter of 2016, after I told him that my friends and former colleagues’ applications for PR had been approved, he told me he was now interested in immigrating to Canada and wouldn’t stop disturbing me so I eventually gave in and started the process. I searched the CIC link and read about the process like I was going to write a professional exam. <br><br><b>IELTS</b><br>By November 2014, my employment had been terminated by AMCON alongside all other colleagues so I had more time to study for IELTS. I had a set of 10 practice questions that I got from one of my friends in 2014 which my husband and I used to prepare for IELTS. We registered in March 2016 and wrote the exam in April 2016. I practiced for a month while my husband practiced for just a week (he kept asking me why I was studying so hard and if he would pass the exam at all).<br>That was our only attempt. Thank God!<br><br><b>ECA (WES)</b><br>We registered with WES for ECA in March 2016 and it seemed we would get it sorted out in a month or two but alas, it took 5 months! It took ‘forever’ for our schools to get the copies of our transcripts and certificates for verification but once our schools did, it took about a month to complete the process. It was a long wait but that was the beginning of so many others in this journey.<br><br><b>EXPRESS ENTRY PROFILE</b><br>Immediately we received our ECAs, I created our Express Entry profiles in August 2016. Our CRS scores at the time were really low as we were both over 40. Mine was 413 and my husband’s was way less (I can’t remember the exact score but around 331 or so). At this point, we knew we had to pursue the option of going the PNP route.<br><br>We had to create a second Express Entry profile when our profiles expired after a year of not achieving much. Patience is indeed a virtue my people.<br><br><b>SINP (SASKATCHEWAN IMMIGRANT NOMINEE PROGRAM) NOMINATION</b><br>I was determined not to give up on this journey and God sent a good friend and sister of mine to me in September 2016. She told me about the SINP and added me to two WhatsApp groups. At that time, our NOCs were not included in their Occupation In-Demand list but there was a NOC we thought was close to my husband’s so we created two profiles (EE and OID-paper-based) and uploaded all necessary documents while waiting for the programs to open. We eventually submitted both that year/January 2017 and we were asked to choose one of the programs we wanted to be processed. We chose the SINP EE program and by May 2017, the application was rejected due to a wrong NOC. We prayed and hoped that one of our NOCs would be added to their OID list and thank God it happened sometime in August 2017 or so. My husband’s NOC was added to the list and we created a new profile and waited for the program to open for submission. <br><br>On October 26, 2017, we paid CAD300 and submitted the application. It was a very long wait of constantly checking the profile to see if there was any progress made. The application was in process until February 7, 2018 when we received ADR which we responded to on February 11, 2018. The status didn’t change from ‘waiting on applicant’ almost two months after we had responded to the ADR. Someone in one of the WhatsApp groups I joined, who also was in the same situation, mentioned that he sent an email to the Manager in charge of the program and got a reply that a decision had been made and he will hear from them soon. He got his letter of nomination that same day. I told my husband about it and after waiting for a while, we decided to follow suit. On April 3, 2018, we sent a very polite email stating that we had sent the additional documents requested for and there was no change in the status of the application. On April 6, 2018, at about a few minutes after 12am when I had just gone to bed <b>(worried that our IELTS reports would expire on April 30, 2018 i.e. in less than 4 weeks)</b>, my husband woke me up with the news of an update. I quickly got off my bed to check his profile and low and behold, it was our nomination letter. I rolled on the floor thanking God and asking Him to forgive me for doubting and almost giving up. I couldn’t sleep that night. I checked his Express Entry profile and found out that some parts of the profile had not been transmitted so I stayed up dotting the ‘I’s and crossing the ‘t’s. <br>I discovered that the EE profile number and job seeker validation code stated in the nomination letter were those of the expired EE profile and had to send them an email immediately requesting that they kindly issue a revised nomination letter with the current details which they did as soon as they resumed work.<br>We accepted the nomination that same day (April 6, 2018) and my husband’s CRS score jumped to 900 plus. <br><br><b>PCC</b><br>We contacted someone whom my friend and sister (the same one that added me to the SINP WhatsApp groups) introduced me to and went to Ikoyi on April 9, 2018 to get our PCCs done. It took about an hour and a half to get the PCCs for N5,000 each.<br><br><b>ITA</b><br>ITA came on April 11, 2018 (five days after SINP nomination) and it was another happy moment.<br><br>MEDICALS<br>I called IOM on April 16, 2018 and got an appointment for the next day. The process took about 3 hours from when they allowed us in at 8am. <br><br><b>POF</b><br>We had a joint investment account that we had opened in 2011 with more than the sum required for a family of 4 with a financial institution (not a bank but a CBN licensed FI). We were given a detailed letter and the statement of account stamped and signed.<br><br><b>WORK EXPERIENCE REFERENCE</b><br>My husband got a letter from his former colleague for two years of his last ten years of work experience (as the company was no longer in existence) and got reference letters from his clients for the remaining eight years. He also got his company’s bank statement and highlighted each payment made by each client on client by client basis. It was easier at this point because this had been done when we applied for the SINP nomination. He had 40 pages of bank statement to work on but thank God he did a good job. This was one thing he actively participated in throughout the process….LOL.<br>If you ever asked him about the EE and PNP process, he would tell you to ask his wife. He referred quite a number of people to me (he still does) and I was happy to help.<br><br><b>AOR</b><br>We submitted our application on April 23, 2018 <b>(7 days to the expiration of our IELTS reports)</b>. It was such a huge relief. <br><br><b>POST AOR</b><br>Medicals Passed – April 27, 2018.<br>We thought it was going to be a smooth and fast journey to PPR getting an update 4 days after AOR. Little did we know that we still had a long journey ahead of us. We had learnt patience and perseverance during the journey so far but this part of the long wait was even more frustrating to say the least.<br>We didn’t receive any update for the normal processing time (6 months). I kept checking the EE profile and my husband’s email account every other day (sometimes several times a day) but nothing changed. I knew about ordering the GCMS notes but we decided to be even more patient. <br>In November 2018, I filled the web form (I didn’t know the VO processing the application so I chose within Canada). We received an email notifying us of our VO, the notorious AVO! We immediately filled another Web form and AVO informed us that our application was in queue for review. We were discouraged by some friends in Canada from requesting for the GCMS notes in October but decided to do so in December when there was still no progress and AVO would not respond to our Web form. <br><br>At this point, while searching for another means of communication with AVO apart from the Web form, I stumbled upon this great Platform. I joined this platform on December 6, 2018 and asked how I could reach them apart from using the web form. <b>@abakiki</b> mentioned that I could send them an email (God bless you).<br><br>I ordered the GCMS notes in December 2018 and got it in January 2019. From the notes, the application had been transferred to AVO on May 17, 2018 after the last case analyst in CIO recommended a review of the lead statement, main duties and work experience but AVO had not touched the application since it was transferred to them. <br><br>I decided to check the EE profile less and take my mind off the matter though I somehow believed that one day it will end in praise.

This was some 7 months before the introduction of the Express Entry System. I quickly joined in preparing for IELTS and was excited about the possibility of immigrating though I had always believed in living in Nigeria and just visiting other countries for exposure and relaxation. My excitement was cut short by my hubby when I told him about it and he said I could go ahead with the process but that he was not going to write any exam and he would gladly visit us from time to time. I tried to convince him but to no avail so I let it go. My only regret was that I didn’t carry out any research about the process and thought that I couldn’t meet the requirements without my husband writing the IELTS test based on the information I got from people.<br><br>One day in the first quarter of 2016, after I told him that my friends and former colleagues’ applications for PR had been approved, he told me he was now interested in immigrating to Canada and wouldn’t stop disturbing me so I eventually gave in and started the process. I searched the CIC link and read about the process like I was going to write a professional exam. <br><br><b>IELTS</b><br>By November 2014, my employment had been terminated by AMCON alongside all other colleagues so I had more time to study for IELTS. I had a set of 10 practice questions that I got from one of my friends in 2014 which my husband and I used to prepare for IELTS. We registered in March 2016 and wrote the exam in April 2016. I practiced for a month while my husband practiced for just a week (he kept asking me why I was studying so hard and if he would pass the exam at all).<br>That was our only attempt. Thank God!<br><br><b>ECA (WES)</b><br>We registered with WES for ECA in March 2016 and it seemed we would get it sorted out in a month or two but alas, it took 5 months! It took ‘forever’ for our schools to get the copies of our transcripts and certificates for verification but once our schools did, it took about a month to complete the process. It was a long wait but that was the beginning of so many others in this journey.<br><br><b>EXPRESS ENTRY PROFILE</b><br>Immediately we received our ECAs, I created our Express Entry profiles in August 2016. Our CRS scores at the time were really low as we were both over 40. Mine was 413 and my husband’s was way less (I can’t remember the exact score but around 331 or so). At this point, we knew we had to pursue the option of going the PNP route.<br><br>We had to create a second Express Entry profile when our profiles expired after a year of not achieving much. Patience is indeed a virtue my people.<br><br><b>SINP (SASKATCHEWAN IMMIGRANT NOMINEE PROGRAM) NOMINATION</b><br>I was determined not to give up on this journey and God sent a good friend and sister of mine to me in September 2016. She told me about the SINP and added me to two WhatsApp groups. At that time, our NOCs were not included in their Occupation In-Demand list but there was a NOC we thought was close to my husband’s so we created two profiles (EE and OID-paper-based) and uploaded all necessary documents while waiting for the programs to open. We eventually submitted both that year/January 2017 and we were asked to choose one of the programs we wanted to be processed. We chose the SINP EE program and by May 2017, the application was rejected due to a wrong NOC. We prayed and hoped that one of our NOCs would be added to their OID list and thank God it happened sometime in August 2017 or so. My husband’s NOC was added to the list and we created a new profile and waited for the program to open for submission. <br><br>On October 26, 2017, we paid CAD300 and submitted the application. It was a very long wait of constantly checking the profile to see if there was any progress made. The application was in process until February 7, 2018 when we received ADR which we responded to on February 11, 2018. The status didn’t change from ‘waiting on applicant’ almost two months after we had responded to the ADR. Someone in one of the WhatsApp groups I joined, who also was in the same situation, mentioned that he sent an email to the Manager in charge of the program and got a reply that a decision had been made and he will hear from them soon. He got his letter of nomination that same day. I told my husband about it and after waiting for a while, we decided to follow suit. On April 3, 2018, we sent a very polite email stating that we had sent the additional documents requested for and there was no change in the status of the application. On April 6, 2018, at about a few minutes after 12am when I had just gone to bed <b>(worried that our IELTS reports would expire on April 30, 2018 i.e. in less than 4 weeks)</b>, my husband woke me up with the news of an update. I quickly got off my bed to check his profile and low and behold, it was our nomination letter. I rolled on the floor thanking God and asking Him to forgive me for doubting and almost giving up. I couldn’t sleep that night. I checked his Express Entry profile and found out that some parts of the profile had not been transmitted so I stayed up dotting the ‘I’s and crossing the ‘t’s. <br>I discovered that the EE profile number and job seeker validation code stated in the nomination letter were those of the expired EE profile and had to send them an email immediately requesting that they kindly issue a revised nomination letter with the current details which they did as soon as they resumed work.<br>We accepted the nomination that same day (April 6, 2018) and my husband’s CRS score jumped to 900 plus. <br><br><b>PCC</b><br>We contacted someone whom my friend and sister (the same one that added me to the SINP WhatsApp groups) introduced me to and went to Ikoyi on April 9, 2018 to get our PCCs done. It took about an hour and a half to get the PCCs for N5,000 each.<br><br><b>ITA</b><br>ITA came on April 11, 2018 (five days after SINP nomination) and it was another happy moment.<br><br>MEDICALS<br>I called IOM on April 16, 2018 and got an appointment for the next day. The process took about 3 hours from when they allowed us in at 8am. <br><br><b>POF</b><br>We had a joint investment account that we had opened in 2011 with more than the sum required for a family of 4 with a financial institution (not a bank but a CBN licensed FI). We were given a detailed letter and the statement of account stamped and signed.<br><br><b>WORK EXPERIENCE REFERENCE</b><br>My husband got a letter from his former colleague for two years of his last ten years of work experience (as the company was no longer in existence) and got reference letters from his clients for the remaining eight years. He also got his company’s bank statement and highlighted each payment made by each client on client by client basis. It was easier at this point because this had been done when we applied for the SINP nomination. He had 40 pages of bank statement to work on but thank God he did a good job. This was one thing he actively participated in throughout the process….LOL.<br>If you ever asked him about the EE and PNP process, he would tell you to ask his wife. He referred quite a number of people to me (he still does) and I was happy to help.<br><br><b>AOR</b><br>We submitted our application on April 23, 2018 <b>(7 days to the expiration of our IELTS reports)</b>. It was such a huge relief. <br><br><b>POST AOR</b><br>Medicals Passed – April 27, 2018.<br>We thought it was going to be a smooth and fast journey to PPR getting an update 4 days after AOR. Little did we know that we still had a long journey ahead of us. We had learnt patience and perseverance during the journey so far but this part of the long wait was even more frustrating to say the least.<br>We didn’t receive any update for the normal processing time (6 months). I kept checking the EE profile and my husband’s email account every other day (sometimes several times a day) but nothing changed. I knew about ordering the GCMS notes but we decided to be even more patient. <br>In November 2018, I filled the web form (I didn’t know the VO processing the application so I chose within Canada). We received an email notifying us of our VO, the notorious AVO! We immediately filled another Web form and AVO informed us that our application was in queue for review. We were discouraged by some friends in Canada from requesting for the GCMS notes in October but decided to do so in December when there was still no progress and AVO would not respond to our Web form. <br><br>At this point, while searching for another means of communication with AVO apart from the Web form, I stumbled upon this great Platform. I joined this platform on December 6, 2018 and asked how I could reach them apart from using the web form. <b>@abakiki</b> mentioned that I could send them an email (God bless you).<br><br>I ordered the GCMS notes in December 2018 and got it in January 2019.

This was some 7 months before the introduction of the Express Entry System. I quickly joined in preparing for IELTS and was excited about the possibility of immigrating though I had always believed in living in Nigeria and just visiting other countries for exposure and relaxation. My excitement was cut short by my hubby when I told him about it and he said I could go ahead with the process but that he was not going to write any exam and he would gladly visit us from time to time. I tried to convince him but to no avail so I let it go. My only regret was that I didn’t carry out any research about the process and thought that I couldn’t meet the requirements without my husband writing the IELTS test based on the information I got from people.<br><br>One day in the first quarter of 2016, after I told him that my friends and former colleagues’ applications for PR had been approved, he told me he was now interested in immigrating to Canada and wouldn’t stop disturbing me so I eventually gave in and started the process. I searched the CIC link and read about the process like I was going to write a professional exam. <br><br><b>IELTS</b><br>By November 2014, my employment had been terminated by AMCON alongside all other colleagues so I had more time to study for IELTS. I had a set of 10 practice questions that I got from one of my friends in 2014 which my husband and I used to prepare for IELTS. We registered in March 2016 and wrote the exam in April 2016. I practiced for a month while my husband practiced for just a week (he kept asking me why I was studying so hard and if he would pass the exam at all).<br>That was our only attempt. Thank God!<br><br><b>ECA (WES)</b><br>We registered with WES for ECA in March 2016 and it seemed we would get it sorted out in a month or two but alas, it took 5 months! It took ‘forever’ for our schools to get the copies of our transcripts and certificates for verification but once our schools did, it took about a month to complete the process. It was a long wait but that was the beginning of so many others in this journey.<br><br><b>EXPRESS ENTRY PROFILE</b><br>Immediately we received our ECAs, I created our Express Entry profiles in August 2016. Our CRS scores at the time were really low as we were both over 40. Mine was 413 and my husband’s was way less (I can’t remember the exact score but around 331 or so). At this point, we knew we had to pursue the option of going the PNP route.<br><br>We had to create a second Express Entry profile when our profiles expired after a year of not achieving much. Patience is indeed a virtue my people.<br><br><b>SINP (SASKATCHEWAN IMMIGRANT NOMINEE PROGRAM) NOMINATION</b><br>I was determined not to give up on this journey and God sent a good friend and sister of mine to me in September 2016. She told me about the SINP and added me to two WhatsApp groups. At that time, our NOCs were not included in their Occupation In-Demand list but there was a NOC we thought was close to my husband’s so we created two profiles (EE and OID-paper-based) and uploaded all necessary documents while waiting for the programs to open. We eventually submitted both that year/January 2017 and we were asked to choose one of the programs we wanted to be processed. We chose the SINP EE program and by May 2017, the application was rejected due to a wrong NOC. We prayed and hoped that one of our NOCs would be added to their OID list and thank God it happened sometime in August 2017 or so. My husband’s NOC was added to the list and we created a new profile and waited for the program to open for submission. <br><br>On October 26, 2017, we paid CAD300 and submitted the application. It was a very long wait of constantly checking the profile to see if there was any progress made. The application was in process until February 7, 2018 when we received ADR which we responded to on February 11, 2018. The status didn’t change from ‘waiting on applicant’ almost two months after we had responded to the ADR. Someone in one of the WhatsApp groups I joined, who also was in the same situation, mentioned that he sent an email to the Manager in charge of the program and got a reply that a decision had been made and he will hear from them soon. He got his letter of nomination that same day. I told my husband about it and after waiting for a while, we decided to follow suit. On April 3, 2018, we sent a very polite email stating that we had sent the additional documents requested for and there was no change in the status of the application. On April 6, 2018, at about a few minutes after 12am when I had just gone to bed <b>(worried that our IELTS reports would expire on April 30, 2018 i.e. in less than 4 weeks)</b>, my husband woke me up with the news of an update. I quickly got off my bed to check his profile and low and behold, it was our nomination letter. I rolled on the floor thanking God and asking Him to forgive me for doubting and almost giving up. I couldn’t sleep that night. I checked his Express Entry profile and found out that some parts of the profile had not been transmitted so I stayed up dotting the ‘I’s and crossing the ‘t’s. <br>I discovered that the EE profile number and job seeker validation code stated in the nomination letter were those of the expired EE profile and had to send them an email immediately requesting that they kindly issue a revised nomination letter with the current details which they did as soon as they resumed work.<br>We accepted the nomination that same day (April 6, 2018) and my husband’s CRS score jumped to 900 plus. <br><br><b>PCC</b><br>We contacted someone whom my friend and sister (the same one that added me to the SINP WhatsApp groups) introduced me to and went to Ikoyi on April 9, 2018 to get our PCCs done. It took about an hour and a half to get the PCCs for N5,000 each.<br><br><b>ITA</b><br>ITA came on April 11, 2018 (five days after SINP nomination) and it was another happy moment.<br><br>MEDICALS<br>I called IOM on April 16, 2018 and got an appointment for the next day. The process took about 3 hours from when they allowed us in at 8am. <br><br><b>POF</b><br>We had a joint investment account that we had opened in 2011 with more than the sum required for a family of 4 with a financial institution (not a bank but a CBN licensed FI). We were given a detailed letter and the statement of account stamped and signed.<br><br><b>WORK EXPERIENCE REFERENCE</b><br>My husband got a letter from his former colleague for two years of his last ten years of work experience (as the company was no longer in existence) and got reference letters from his clients for the remaining eight years. He also got his company’s bank statement and highlighted each payment made by each client on client by client basis. It was easier at this point because this had been done when we applied for the SINP nomination. He had 40 pages of bank statement to work on but thank God he did a good job. This was one thing he actively participated in throughout the process….LOL.<br>If you ever asked him about the EE and PNP process, he would tell you to ask his wife. He referred quite a number of people to me (he still does) and I was happy to help.<br><br><b>AOR</b><br>We submitted our application on April 23, 2018 <b>(7 days to the expiration of our IELTS reports)</b>. It was such a huge relief. <br><br><b>POST AOR</b><br>Medicals Passed – April 27, 2018.<br>We thought it was going to be a smooth and fast journey to PPR getting an update 4 days after AOR. Little did we know that we still had a long journey ahead of us. We had learnt patience and perseverance during the journey so far but this part of the long wait was even more frustrating to say the least.<br>We didn’t receive any update for the normal processing time (6 months). I kept checking the EE profile and my husband’s email account every other day (sometimes several times a day) but nothing changed. I knew about ordering the GCMS notes but we decided to be even more patient. <br>In November 2018, I filled the web form (I didn’t know the VO processing the application so I chose within Canada). We received an email notifying us of our VO, the notorious AVO! We immediately filled another Web form and AVO informed us that our application was in queue for review. We were discouraged by some friends in Canada from requesting for the GCMS notes in October but decided to do so in December when there was still no progress and AVO would not respond to our Web form. <br><br>At this point, while searching for another means of communication with AVO apart from the Web form, I stumbled upon this great Platform. I joined this platform on December 6, 2018 and asked how I could reach them apart from using the web form. <b>@abakiki</b> mentioned that I could send them an email (God bless you).<br><br>I ordered the GCMS notes in December 2018 and got it in January 2019. From the notes, the application had been transferred to AVO on May 17, 2018 after the last case analyst in CIO recommended a review of the lead statement, main duties and work experience but AVO had not touched the application since it was transferred to them. <br><br>I decided to check the EE profile less and take my mind off the matter though I somehow believed that one day it will end in praise. I was just not sure when the one day would be and prayed that it will happen before April when our Medical reports would expire.<br><br>I ordered another set of GCMS notes in January (my cousin helped with both orders) after submitting another web form to AVO and didn’t receive any response. On February 5, 2019, I decided to send an email to AVO (as advised by <b>@abakiki</b> in December) enquiring about the status of the application and politely informing them that our application had been in queue for review and we were unable to plan appropriately for the year. We received an automated reply almost immediately that they would respond shortly. About an hour later, there was an update on the EE profile (the first since April 27, 2018). We were requested to submit the following:<br>-Schedule A Form (PA and Spouse)<br>-Additional Family Information Form (PA and Spouse)<br>-Updated Proof of Settlement Funds<br><br>On February 7, 2019, I tried uploading the additional documents but one was too large so I decided to upload later that day after compressing the file. Before I had the chance to upload the documents, we received another update. I was so scared to sign in and check what it was. When I did, it was another request but this time, it was PPR!!! We didn’t know how to express our joy, relief, excitement and gratitude to God. We are truly grateful to God and thankful for all the people He sent our way while on this journey. We were way older than the ‘favourable’ age group but God made it happen. Do your part and leave the ‘how’ to God. His grace is sufficient for you.<br><br>Once again, a BIG THANK YOU to all of you who have been very magnanimous with your time and wealth of knowledge on this platform. Rest assured that your labour of love will be greatly rewarded. Though I joined this platform long after we had submitted our application, I was encouraged and sometimes entertained by the many posts and responses I got. It was great to celebrate with other PPR recipients while waiting for ours.<br><br><b>@ifeoma77</b>, I have noticed your dedication to helping people and I know that we will celebrate with you very soon by His grace. God bless you immensely.<br><br>I wish everyone who's still in the race, about starting or already a PR, God’s very best. Keep on moving…….<br><br>God bless you all.<br><br><br><br><br>   <br><br>[/quote]</div>",7:24pm,Feb-27,2019

If you are not able to submit your application on time and it stretches to the 60days period which is almost 2/3 months on your medicals already and your application takes a long time to decide, your medicals might expire or if PPR is granted very close to medical expiry, you will need to redo medicals at some point</div>",7:58pm,Feb-27,2019

I practiced for a month while my husband practiced for just a week (he kept asking me why I was studying so hard and if he would pass the exam at all).<br>That was our only attempt. Thank God!<br><br><b>ECA (WES)</b><br>We registered with WES for ECA in March 2016 and it seemed we would get it sorted out in a month or two but alas, it took 5 months! It took ‘forever’ for our schools to get the copies of our transcripts and certificates for verification but once our schools did, it took about a month to complete the process. It was a long wait but that was the beginning of so many others in this journey.<br><br><b>EXPRESS ENTRY PROFILE</b><br>Immediately we received our ECAs, I created our Express Entry profiles in August 2016. Our CRS scores at the time were really low as we were both over 40. Mine was 413 and my husband’s was way less (I can’t remember the exact score but around 331 or so). At this point, we knew we had to pursue the option of going the PNP route.<br><br>We had to create a second Express Entry profile when our profiles expired after a year of not achieving much. Patience is indeed a virtue my people.<br><br><b>SINP (SASKATCHEWAN IMMIGRANT NOMINEE PROGRAM) NOMINATION</b><br>I was determined not to give up on this journey and God sent a good friend and sister of mine to me in September 2016. She told me about the SINP and added me to two WhatsApp groups. At that time, our NOCs were not included in their Occupation In-Demand list but there was a NOC we thought was close to my husband’s so we created two profiles (EE and OID-paper-based) and uploaded all necessary documents while waiting for the programs to open. We eventually submitted both that year/January 2017 and we were asked to choose one of the programs we wanted to be processed. We chose the SINP EE program and by May 2017, the application was rejected due to a wrong NOC. We prayed and hoped that one of our NOCs would be added to their OID list and thank God it happened sometime in August 2017 or so. My husband’s NOC was added to the list and we created a new profile and waited for the program to open for submission. <br><br>On October 26, 2017, we paid CAD300 and submitted the application. It was a very long wait of constantly checking the profile to see if there was any progress made. The application was in process until February 7, 2018 when we received ADR which we responded to on February 11, 2018. The status didn’t change from ‘waiting on applicant’ almost two months after we had responded to the ADR. Someone in one of the WhatsApp groups I joined, who also was in the same situation, mentioned that he sent an email to the Manager in charge of the program and got a reply that a decision had been made and he will hear from them soon. He got his letter of nomination that same day. I told my husband about it and after waiting for a while, we decided to follow suit. On April 3, 2018, we sent a very polite email stating that we had sent the additional documents requested for and there was no change in the status of the application. On April 6, 2018, at about a few minutes after 12am when I had just gone to bed <b>(worried that our IELTS reports would expire on April 30, 2018 i.e. in less than 4 weeks)</b>, my husband woke me up with the news of an update. I quickly got off my bed to check his profile and low and behold, it was our nomination letter. I rolled on the floor thanking God and asking Him to forgive me for doubting and almost giving up. I couldn’t sleep that night. I checked his Express Entry profile and found out that some parts of the profile had not been transmitted so I stayed up dotting the ‘I’s and crossing the ‘t’s. <br>I discovered that the EE profile number and job seeker validation code stated in the nomination letter were those of the expired EE profile and had to send them an email immediately requesting that they kindly issue a revised nomination letter with the current details which they did as soon as they resumed work.<br>We accepted the nomination that same day (April 6, 2018) and my husband’s CRS score jumped to 900 plus. <br><br><b>PCC</b><br>We contacted someone whom my friend and sister (the same one that added me to the SINP WhatsApp groups) introduced me to and went to Ikoyi on April 9, 2018 to get our PCCs done. It took about an hour and a half to get the PCCs for N5,000 each.<br><br><b>ITA</b><br>ITA came on April 11, 2018 (five days after SINP nomination) and it was another happy moment.<br><br>MEDICALS<br>I called IOM on April 16, 2018 and got an appointment for the next day. The process took about 3 hours from when they allowed us in at 8am. <br><br><b>POF</b><br>We had a joint investment account that we had opened in 2011 with more than the sum required for a family of 4 with a financial institution (not a bank but a CBN licensed FI). We were given a detailed letter and the statement of account stamped and signed.<br><br><b>WORK EXPERIENCE REFERENCE</b><br>My husband got a letter from his former colleague for two years of his last ten years of work experience (as the company was no longer in existence) and got reference letters from his clients for the remaining eight years. He also got his company’s bank statement and highlighted each payment made by each client on client by client basis. It was easier at this point because this had been done when we applied for the SINP nomination. He had 40 pages of bank statement to work on but thank God he did a good job. This was one thing he actively participated in throughout the process….LOL.<br>If you ever asked him about the EE and PNP process, he would tell you to ask his wife. He referred quite a number of people to me (he still does) and I was happy to help.<br><br><b>AOR</b><br>We submitted our application on April 23, 2018 <b>(7 days to the expiration of our IELTS reports)</b>. It was such a huge relief. <br><br><b>POST AOR</b><br>Medicals Passed – April 27, 2018.<br>We thought it was going to be a smooth and fast journey to PPR getting an update 4 days after AOR. Little did we know that we still had a long journey ahead of us. We had learnt patience and perseverance during the journey so far but this part of the long wait was even more frustrating to say the least.<br>We didn’t receive any update for the normal processing time (6 months). I kept checking the EE profile and my husband’s email account every other day (sometimes several times a day) but nothing changed. I knew about ordering the GCMS notes but we decided to be even more patient. <br>In November 2018, I filled the web form (I didn’t know the VO processing the application so I chose within Canada). We received an email notifying us of our VO, the notorious AVO! We immediately filled another Web form and AVO informed us that our application was in queue for review. We were discouraged by some friends in Canada from requesting for the GCMS notes in October but decided to do so in December when there was still no progress and AVO would not respond to our Web form. <br><br>At this point, while searching for another means of communication with AVO apart from the Web form, I stumbled upon this great Platform. I joined this platform on December 6, 2018 and asked how I could reach them apart from using the web form. <b>@abakiki</b> mentioned that I could send them an email (God bless you).<br><br>I ordered the GCMS notes in December 2018 and got it in January 2019. From the notes, the application had been transferred to AVO on May 17, 2018 after the last case analyst in CIO recommended a review of the lead statement, main duties and work experience but AVO had not touched the application since it was transferred to them. <br><br>I decided to check the EE profile less and take my mind off the matter though I somehow believed that one day it will end in praise. I was just not sure when the one day would be and prayed that it will happen before April when our Medical reports would expire.<br><br>I ordered another set of GCMS notes in January (my cousin helped with both orders) after submitting another web form to AVO and didn’t receive any response. On February 5, 2019, I decided to send an email to AVO (as advised by <b>@abakiki</b> in December) enquiring about the status of the application and politely informing them that our application had been in queue for review and we were unable to plan appropriately for the year. We received an automated reply almost immediately that they would respond shortly. About an hour later, there was an update on the EE profile (the first since April 27, 2018). We were requested to submit the following:<br>-Schedule A Form (PA and Spouse)<br>-Additional Family Information Form (PA and Spouse)<br>-Updated Proof of Settlement Funds<br><br>On February 7, 2019, I tried uploading the additional documents but one was too large so I decided to upload later that day after compressing the file. Before I had the chance to upload the documents, we received another update. I was so scared to sign in and check what it was. When I did, it was another request but this time, it was PPR!!! We didn’t know how to express our joy, relief, excitement and gratitude to God. We are truly grateful to God and thankful for all the people He sent our way while on this journey. We were way older than the ‘favourable’ age group but God made it happen. Do your part and leave the ‘how’ to God. His grace is sufficient for you.<br><br>Once again, a BIG THANK YOU to all of you who have been very magnanimous with your time and wealth of knowledge on this platform. Rest assured that your labour of love will be greatly rewarded. Though I joined this platform long after we had submitted our application, I was encouraged and sometimes entertained by the many posts and responses I got. It was great to celebrate with other PPR recipients while waiting for ours.<br><br><b>@ifeoma77</b>, I have noticed your dedication to helping people and I know that we will celebrate with you very soon by His grace. God bless you immensely.<br><br>I wish everyone who's still in the race, about starting or already a PR, God’s very best. Keep on moving…….<br><br>God bless you all.<br><br><br><br><br>   <br><br></blockquote></div>",11:50am,Feb-28,2019

"<div class=""narrow"">Get your Affidavit for confirmation of WAEC result first at High Court, I got mine at Igbosere behind TBS because of proximity to work, I must say that they are lions waiting at the gate to reap you off please beware! Typing and printing the affidavit is just 200 naira, then stamping it and getting the seal is 500 naira. Don't forget to take two passport photographs with you to the High court, You must also request for a receipt after stamping. The receipt issued will have #250 on it, but you know how far now. Lmao<br><br>After getting your affidavit, you must take these things below to the WAEC office.<br><br>1. 2 passport photographs (Write your reference number from WES at the back of the passport photographs)<br>2. Take 2 small brown envelopes (You are supposed to put the WES address and your reference number on just one of the envelopes)<br>3. WAEC result print out (1 copy is enough)<br>4. WAEC scratch card (You can get the scratch card in front of WAEC office in Yaba, the one they sell inside the WAEC office is not acceptable by WES because its just paper, can you believe that, lol). It cost just #1,500. <br><br>N.B: WES require that they scratch the card themselves, so don't buy a print out but an actual scratch card. <br><br>Now once you get to WAEC office, you can go straight to the reception and the lady you'll meet there would give you a form for you to cross check everything you are supposed to have with you. After that she'll direct you to the main building. But you can skip that part all together and just go straight to the main building. <br><br>Once you get to the main building, you'll sign in and fill a book. You'll be asked what you want and you'll be directed to the office. So I can't really explain where the office is but trust me you'll find people there doing the exact same thing as you, so no worries. <br><br>You'll pay 10,000 to WAEC for the result processing, then 10,000 for courier services. I used Fedex and they were pretty efficient. My result got to WAEC in less than 2 weeks, Fedex even sent me a tracking number prior to that time via text message.<br><br>I hope I have been able to answer your question.

I just came back to the country after my Msc. I rejoined the former coy I worked for before traveling. I got frustrated as my Msc meant nothing to these guys. I was looking for a way out of Nigeria immediately .I stumbled on this thread… not sure which part now. On checking my eligibility,  i saw IELTS as one of the requirement. I just close the browser ( I dislike these exams like kilode ( IELTS, TOEFL,GMAT,SAT) I believed they are not for olodo like me.) <br><br>Fast forward to 2017, I was on one of my many technical support visit to a customer and I asked for the contact person, my resident engineer told me HIM done get Canada Green Card ooo. Me: What..wetin be Canada Green card? That thing na fraud ooo. The guy sha send me link say it’s real.<br><br>I got home, opened the mail and read through, found out its express entry and na so I jam IELST again This time I was determined (now married with a kid). I told my wife about it… madam raised concern about the funding (we had less than 500k in our account) with one building project going on. Joined the thread finally here.<br>WES<br>Na so I sha start with WES in August 2017, being a foreign degree and no waec wahala then, the ECA was ready in less than a month!  Then the preparation for first IELTS. I took the exam in FEB 10 2018 and result wasn’t good. I was determined. Looking at the draw, I knew there was need for madam to write IELTS and evaluate her degree too. We started off with her evaluation which took 4 months (thanks to LASU).. <br>IELTS<br>We registered for IELTS together and preparation begins. By now I know all the tricks to this exam (so I think). We took the exam in July 07 2018 and I came short in writing by 0.5. I requested for a remark and it came positive. Very challenging period as I lost my dad here.<br>POF.<br>We got ITA in Sept 05 2018. By now we had about 3.0 M in our account. I wanted to sell our land/ building. Mother in-law said no. she contacted one of HER children (Sister In-law…. God bless her for me) though we have informed her before… Aunty wire 2M to my wife as gift. Padded we my 25%pension fund (500K) boom POF completed. God bless NewMUM for her input here. Invested the 5m in TB.. Submitted TB certificate, statement of account highlighting cash flow, gift deed. That’s all<br>3M… PERSONAL SAVINGS<br>500K.. 25%PENSION FUND<br>2M GIFT DEED  Total 5.5m… used oando rate for the day.<br><br>NORTH CYPRUS PCC.<br>This one na war. The joy in me right now no reach the one I had on the day I got the PCC. See page one for details. God bless my friend in TRCN and WIP7 (My able Professor). <br>Medical<br>Booked medical ahead since we were sure of ITA ..CRS stands @445 cut off was hovering around 440-442 then. We booked with qlife and for those that remembered my daughter story. She is doing fine now.. Thanks to this wonderful family.<br><br>Reference letter.<br>God bless Newnum. I disturb her like kilode. Gave her my JD, she paraphrased it to and mail back. We concluded on what NOC. Now to my employer. I am one of their best staff. Knowing about my intension to emigrate won’t go well with my Oga. He might Block it. I have a very senior management staff whom I trust. I approached him and he asked me to send the letter to him. He signed and also gave his BIZ ID. Letter was notarized and backed up with LOE I added my EMPLOYMENT LETTER, PROMOTTION LETTER, TAX CARD, APPRECIATION LETTER, PAYSLIP ( THREE MONTH) . NewMum gave the go ahead. (PLEASE DO NOT USE COY LETTER HEAD EVEN IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO IT WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF THE NECESSARY PEOPLE IN YOUR OFFICE)<br>POST AOR.<br>Application submitted OCT 19.Then the wait begins. First was the MEP/BIL. I was happy because we came through with medicals. I also shared the good news with my family here. Got another JOB with a multinational and had to inform IRCC. Was on a business trip when request for RFRP came FEB 7 2019. Paid second day. Then ghost update FEB 16th. On 19th came a request letter (NOT PPR LOL). I was denied UK visiting VISA sometimes in 2015. This was declared in my application. CIC requested to see the letter (may be to check reason for denial). I submitted same day. Then wait continues….another Ghost Update Feb 27 2019 and today 28th Feb is PPR.. Letter dated 27.<br><br>Once again… Thanks to God Almighty the Beginning and the End.

"<div class=""narrow""><span style=""color:#000099;"">Well done. I salute your efforts in the process of completing POF.<br><br>One rule of thumb about POF is that the funds must be readily accessible to you without any encumbrance of some sort. Encumbrance such as the need to repay, the need to wait for a long time or inability to access the funds at the time you want to leave for CA.<br><br>Once you are sure that the UN pension satisfies this, then you can add it. However, bear in mind that the visa officers are most likely used to processing Nigerian applications with pension stating that only 25% is accessible after 4 months of unemployment. So you may want to provide more evidence or an extract of their promulgation where it is clearly spelt out that the complete 100% is accessible. Attach them as an evidence to convince the VO.<br><br>As for the second question, you can get the letter from the welfare scheme chairman clearly stating that they are entirely your savings and ""can be accessed whenever you need the funds"" This has to be clearly stated by the chairman in the letter. You can then attach a statement or savings history that shows how much you have saved overtime in the scheme (preferably in the scheme's letterhead).<br><br>Good luck.</span><br><br><br><blockquote><a href=""/post/76269403""><b>Amandacanny</b></a>:<br>Elders in the house,  the way you guys are getting PPR ehn,  I think is better I ask my questions now before you guys get overwhelmed with travel preparations.  Hubby works with UN and their own pension is with UN and you can actually take the entire100% upon resignation. Can we use his pension funds as Pof even though he is not the principal applicant? Secondly,  I belong to staff welfare scheme where deductions are made monthly on our salary as savings for us.  You can take the total savings when resigning.

But while IQAS has no need for WAEC and verification, WES does. However, WES is faster than IQAS if her school responds to the verification immediately.<br>Since you still have to wait till her work experience is complete, I'll advice IQAS.<br>Another reason for me supporting IQAS is; so far (according to their website) they are the only ones who still give that allowance for you to send your sealed transcript yourself.

He feels I'm not taking this opportunity now that I have the chance. As Luck will have it, I visited my big bro on the day and he inquired on why we were shouting over the phone. My brother encouraged me to give it a shot. And that was all the push I needed.<br><br><b>ECA</b> Registered with WES on the same 29th July, applied for Unilag transcript on the same 29th July, 2018. ECA came back on October, 21st.<br><br><b>IELTS</b> Registered with BC on 30th July, 2018. Sat for the exam on 8th September, 2018. Scores came back as LRWS: 8.5, 8.5, 7, 7.5. I couldn't sleep that night. <br><br><b>Medicals</b> Had my medicals on 24th September, 2018 at IOM Lagos.<br><br><b>PCC</b> Inspector Moshood to the rescue. He sent it through courier.<br><br><br><b>ITA</b> ITA finally came on the 29th of October, 2018.  I was ready. Had all my documentations ready. I claimed points with my 1 year NYSC. POF was gift deed from my brother. <br><br><b>AOR</b> Submitted my application on the 31st of October. But the AOR letter was dated 1st of November. <br><br>Then the wait started. <br><br>MEP came on the 29th November, gave my biometrics on the 30th.<br><br>Got married and informed CIC on the 3rd of January. I got ADR on the 7th. I submitted the ADR on 10th January. I need to point out here that my ADR was labelled Application Transferred. I paid little attention to that label until I raised CSE to submit updated POF.<br><br>The reply to the CSE confirmed that my application is in ACCRA!!!! I was shocked, Mad, Crazy, angry, surprised, devastated. Accra had a reputation. But my wife kept reassuring me that our case will be different. And that became our prayer point.<br><br>On the 6th of February, I got a. Notification that there's a message in my CIC account. I logged in to see an interview invite. I was invited to Accra for interview with my wife on the 19th February. <br><br>We started preparing with the help of the amazing people in my Accra WhatsApp group and November AOR group. <br><br>The interview went well, we spent less than 20 minutes in the interview. The interviewer ended the interview saying she'll send a request for wifey to do Biometrics.<br><br>The request came on the 20th. Wifey did the biometrics on the 20th. Then silence. I got worried. What if the interview didn't go well. What if there's something wrong?<br><br>On the 28th of February, 2019. The last day of the gracious month of February. I got a notification of a message in my account.. I got scared again.. PPR comes through email. What notification are they sending me in my CIC Account. Only to log in and see the PPR letter as a message in my CIC account. <br><br>My life just paused. I started feeling warm and cold at the same time. It was pure joy. Undisputed happiness.<br><br>I want to thank everyone especially @newmum, Dumprep, every member of the November AOR group, AVO group and the Interview Group. You guys are the Bomb.<br><br>To the people at different stages of the process, Keep faith, Trust the process and more importantly, Trust God.<br><br></blockquote></div>",10:56am,Mar-03,2019

This was some 7 months before the introduction of the Express Entry System. I quickly joined in preparing for IELTS and was excited about the possibility of immigrating though I had always believed in living in Nigeria and just visiting other countries for exposure and relaxation. My excitement was cut short by my hubby when I told him about it and he said I could go ahead with the process but that he was not going to write any exam and he would gladly visit us from time to time. I tried to convince him but to no avail so I let it go. My only regret was that I didn’t carry out any research about the process and thought that I couldn’t meet the requirements without my husband writing the IELTS test based on the information I got from people.<br><br>One day in the first quarter of 2016, after I told him that my friends and former colleagues’ applications for PR had been approved, he told me he was now interested in immigrating to Canada and wouldn’t stop disturbing me so I eventually gave in and started the process. I searched the CIC link and read about the process like I was going to write a professional exam. <br><br><b>IELTS</b><br>By November 2014, my employment had been terminated by AMCON alongside all other colleagues so I had more time to study for IELTS. I had a set of 10 practice questions that I got from one of my friends in 2014 which my husband and I used to prepare for IELTS. We registered in March 2016 and wrote the exam in April 2016. I practiced for a month while my husband practiced for just a week (he kept asking me why I was studying so hard and if he would pass the exam at all).<br>That was our only attempt. Thank God!<br><br><b>ECA (WES)</b><br>We registered with WES for ECA in March 2016 and it seemed we would get it sorted out in a month or two but alas, it took 5 months! It took ‘forever’ for our schools to get the copies of our transcripts and certificates for verification but once our schools did, it took about a month to complete the process. It was a long wait but that was the beginning of so many others in this journey.<br><br><b>EXPRESS ENTRY PROFILE</b><br>Immediately we received our ECAs, I created our Express Entry profiles in August 2016. Our CRS scores at the time were really low as we were both over 40. Mine was 413 and my husband’s was way less (I can’t remember the exact score but around 331 or so). At this point, we knew we had to pursue the option of going the PNP route.<br><br>We had to create a second Express Entry profile when our profiles expired after a year of not achieving much. Patience is indeed a virtue my people.<br><br><b>SINP (SASKATCHEWAN IMMIGRANT NOMINEE PROGRAM) NOMINATION</b><br>I was determined not to give up on this journey and God sent a good friend and sister of mine to me in September 2016. She told me about the SINP and added me to two WhatsApp groups. At that time, our NOCs were not included in their Occupation In-Demand list but there was a NOC we thought was close to my husband’s so we created two profiles (EE and OID-paper-based) and uploaded all necessary documents while waiting for the programs to open. We eventually submitted both that year/January 2017 and we were asked to choose one of the programs we wanted to be processed. We chose the SINP EE program and by May 2017, the application was rejected due to a wrong NOC. We prayed and hoped that one of our NOCs would be added to their OID list and thank God it happened sometime in August 2017 or so. My husband’s NOC was added to the list and we created a new profile and waited for the program to open for submission. <br><br>On October 26, 2017, we paid CAD300 and submitted the application. It was a very long wait of constantly checking the profile to see if there was any progress made. The application was in process until February 7, 2018 when we received ADR which we responded to on February 11, 2018. The status didn’t change from ‘waiting on applicant’ almost two months after we had responded to the ADR. Someone in one of the WhatsApp groups I joined, who also was in the same situation, mentioned that he sent an email to the Manager in charge of the program and got a reply that a decision had been made and he will hear from them soon. He got his letter of nomination that same day. I told my husband about it and after waiting for a while, we decided to follow suit. On April 3, 2018, we sent a very polite email stating that we had sent the additional documents requested for and there was no change in the status of the application. On April 6, 2018, at about a few minutes after 12am when I had just gone to bed <b>(worried that our IELTS reports would expire on April 30, 2018 i.e. in less than 4 weeks)</b>, my husband woke me up with the news of an update. I quickly got off my bed to check his profile and low and behold, it was our nomination letter. I rolled on the floor thanking God and asking Him to forgive me for doubting and almost giving up. I couldn’t sleep that night. I checked his Express Entry profile and found out that some parts of the profile had not been transmitted so I stayed up dotting the ‘I’s and crossing the ‘t’s. <br>I discovered that the EE profile number and job seeker validation code stated in the nomination letter were those of the expired EE profile and had to send them an email immediately requesting that they kindly issue a revised nomination letter with the current details which they did as soon as they resumed work.<br>We accepted the nomination that same day (April 6, 2018) and my husband’s CRS score jumped to 900 plus. <br><br><b>PCC</b><br>We contacted someone whom my friend and sister (the same one that added me to the SINP WhatsApp groups) introduced me to and went to Ikoyi on April 9, 2018 to get our PCCs done. It took about an hour and a half to get the PCCs for N5,000 each.<br><br><b>ITA</b><br>ITA came on April 11, 2018 (five days after SINP nomination) and it was another happy moment.<br><br>MEDICALS<br>I called IOM on April 16, 2018 and got an appointment for the next day. The process took about 3 hours from when they allowed us in at 8am. <br><br><b>POF</b><br>We had a joint investment account that we had opened in 2011 with more than the sum required for a family of 4 with a financial institution (not a bank but a CBN licensed FI). We were given a detailed letter and the statement of account stamped and signed.<br><br><b>WORK EXPERIENCE REFERENCE</b><br>My husband got a letter from his former colleague for two years of his last ten years of work experience (as the company was no longer in existence) and got reference letters from his clients for the remaining eight years. He also got his company’s bank statement and highlighted each payment made by each client on client by client basis. It was easier at this point because this had been done when we applied for the SINP nomination. He had 40 pages of bank statement to work on but thank God he did a good job. This was one thing he actively participated in throughout the process….LOL.<br>If you ever asked him about the EE and PNP process, he would tell you to ask his wife. He referred quite a number of people to me (he still does) and I was happy to help.<br><br><b>AOR</b><br>We submitted our application on April 23, 2018 <b>(7 days to the expiration of our IELTS reports)</b>. It was such a huge relief. <br><br><b>POST AOR</b><br>Medicals Passed – April 27, 2018.<br>We thought it was going to be a smooth and fast journey to PPR getting an update 4 days after AOR. Little did we know that we still had a long journey ahead of us. We had learnt patience and perseverance during the journey so far but this part of the long wait was even more frustrating to say the least.<br>We didn’t receive any update for the normal processing time (6 months). I kept checking the EE profile and my husband’s email account every other day (sometimes several times a day) but nothing changed. I knew about ordering the GCMS notes but we decided to be even more patient. <br>In November 2018, I filled the web form (I didn’t know the VO processing the application so I chose within Canada). We received an email notifying us of our VO, the notorious AVO! We immediately filled another Web form and AVO informed us that our application was in queue for review. We were discouraged by some friends in Canada from requesting for the GCMS notes in October but decided to do so in December when there was still no progress and AVO would not respond to our Web form. <br><br>At this point, while searching for another means of communication with AVO apart from the Web form, I stumbled upon this great Platform. I joined this platform on December 6, 2018 and asked how I could reach them apart from using the web form. <b>@abakiki</b> mentioned that I could send them an email (God bless you).<br><br>I ordered the GCMS notes in December 2018 and got it in January 2019. From the notes, the application had been transferred to AVO on May 17, 2018 after the last case analyst in CIO recommended a review of the lead statement, main duties and work experience but AVO had not touched the application since it was transferred to them. <br><br>I decided to check the EE profile less and take my mind off the matter though I somehow believed that one day it will end in praise. I was just not sure when the one day would be and prayed that it will happen before April when our Medical reports would expire.<br><br>I ordered another set of GCMS notes in January (my cousin helped with both orders) after submitting another web form to AVO and didn’t receive any response. On February 5, 2019, I decided to send an email to AVO (as advised by <b>@abakiki</b> in December) enquiring about the status of the application and politely informing them that our application had been in queue for review and we were unable to plan appropriately for the year. We received an automated reply almost immediately that they would respond shortly. About an hour later, there was an update on the EE profile (the first since April 27, 2018). We were requested to submit the following:<br>-Schedule A Form (PA and Spouse)<br>-Additional Family Information Form (PA and Spouse)<br>-Updated Proof of Settlement Funds<br><br>On February 7, 2019, I tried uploading the additional documents but one was too large so I decided to upload later that day after compressing the file. Before I had the chance to upload the documents, we received another update. I was so scared to sign in and check what it was. When I did, it was another request but this time, it was PPR!!! We didn’t know how to express our joy, relief, excitement and gratitude to God. We are truly grateful to God and thankful for all the people He sent our way while on this journey. We were way older than the ‘favourable’ age group but God made it happen. Do your part and leave the ‘how’ to God. His grace is sufficient for you.<br><br>Once again, a BIG THANK YOU to all of you who have been very magnanimous with your time and wealth of knowledge on this platform. Rest assured that your labour of love will be greatly rewarded. Though I joined this platform long after we had submitted our application, I was encouraged and sometimes entertained by the many posts and responses I got. It was great to celebrate with other PPR recipients while waiting for ours.<br><br><b>@ifeoma77</b>, I have noticed your dedication to helping people and I know that we will celebrate with you very soon by His grace. God bless you immensely.<br><br>I wish everyone who's still in the race, about starting or already a PR, God’s very best. Keep on moving…….<br><br>God bless you all.<br><br><br><br>   <br><br></blockquote> Pls am also interested in the SNIP, but I av some personal questions I need answers to.Can I send u a mail?</div>",12:07pm,Mar-02,2019

There can be changes in personal situations and even IRCC understands that.<br><br>In the ITA letter, it says - ""<i>If you decline this invitation, and you still meet the Express Entry criteria, your Express Entry profile will become active again. Your profile will remain valid until the original expiry date (i.e., the rest of the 365 days from that date of your original Express Entry submission) and will be considered for future rounds of invitation until that time.</i>"". Hell, I could decline as many times as I want to, if my situation warrants it. It doesn't say, ""<i>if you decline this invitation several times, your application will be flagged as a likely case of terrorism</i>"".<br><br>It also says <i>""If, at the 60-day deadline, any of the supporting documentation and information is missing and you do not have a valid reason, your application will be rejected"".</i>.

If you get ITA on March 6, hopefully, you'd have till May 5/6 to submit. I reckon that should give you ample time to complete it seeing as you're almost there.

Also, I wasn't sure of when I was going to complete my POF; even now, I am not 100% sure. From my knowledge, it is better you decline ITA than let the ITA expire; if your ITA expires, your profile will be scrapped, and you can run into trouble when you later apply. <br>I know myself; I may become nonchalant and forget the exact day my ITA would expire. I didn't want to take that chance, and so I declined quickly.<br>What I have resolved to do is this: for any ITA I get, I'll wait for 2-3 weeks, and if there is no hope of completing my POF soonest, I will decline. If my CRS was 450 or below I wouldn't decline so fast, but with CRS 465, I strongly believe I would always get the next ITA(so far I decline 24-48 hours before the next draw; that is the time, I think, it takes to get back into the pool whenever you decline an ITA.<br>Lastly, after I apply, if the visa officer requests for an explanation for my previous ITA declinations(which I doubt they would ask), I will gladly explain why I declined as thus: 'I was not sure of when I would complete my POF'.</blockquote><br>So you'll continue declining ITA until POF is complete? You shouldn't have been in the pool from the get go. <br><br>What you should have done is, since your CRS is high enough to fetch ITA at anytime, wait till your POF is complete.<br><br>This might just be one of many reasons why the CRS cut off is high.</div>",12:10pm,Mar-03,2019

I salute your efforts in the process of completing POF.<br><br>One rule of thumb about POF is that the funds must be readily accessible to you without any encumbrance of some sort. Encumbrance such as the need to repay, the need to wait for a long time or inability to access the funds at the time you want to leave for CA.<br><br>Once you are sure that the UN pension satisfies this, then you can add it. However, bear in mind that the visa officers are most likely used to processing Nigerian applications with pension stating that only 25% is accessible after 4 months of unemployment. So you may want to provide more evidence or an extract of their promulgation where it is clearly spelt out that the complete 100% is accessible. Attach them as an evidence to convince the VO.<br><br>As for the second question, you can get the letter from the welfare scheme chairman clearly stating that they are entirely your savings and ""can be accessed whenever you need the funds"" This has to be clearly stated by the chairman in the letter. You can then attach a statement or savings history that shows how much you have saved overtime in the scheme (preferably in the scheme's letterhead).<br><br>Good luck.</span><br><br><br></blockquote></div>",8:54am,Mar-02,2019

This was some 7 months before the introduction of the Express Entry System. I quickly joined in preparing for IELTS and was excited about the possibility of immigrating though I had always believed in living in Nigeria and just visiting other countries for exposure and relaxation. My excitement was cut short by my hubby when I told him about it and he said I could go ahead with the process but that he was not going to write any exam and he would gladly visit us from time to time. I tried to convince him but to no avail so I let it go. My only regret was that I didn’t carry out any research about the process and thought that I couldn’t meet the requirements without my husband writing the IELTS test based on the information I got from people.<br><br>One day in the first quarter of 2016, after I told him that my friends and former colleagues’ applications for PR had been approved, he told me he was now interested in immigrating to Canada and wouldn’t stop disturbing me so I eventually gave in and started the process. I searched the CIC link and read about the process like I was going to write a professional exam. <br><br><b>IELTS</b><br>By November 2014, my employment had been terminated by AMCON alongside all other colleagues so I had more time to study for IELTS. I had a set of 10 practice questions that I got from one of my friends in 2014 which my husband and I used to prepare for IELTS. We registered in March 2016 and wrote the exam in April 2016. I practiced for a month while my husband practiced for just a week (he kept asking me why I was studying so hard and if he would pass the exam at all).<br>That was our only attempt. Thank God!<br><br><b>ECA (WES)</b><br>We registered with WES for ECA in March 2016 and it seemed we would get it sorted out in a month or two but alas, it took 5 months! It took ‘forever’ for our schools to get the copies of our transcripts and certificates for verification but once our schools did, it took about a month to complete the process. It was a long wait but that was the beginning of so many others in this journey.<br><br><b>EXPRESS ENTRY PROFILE</b><br>Immediately we received our ECAs, I created our Express Entry profiles in August 2016. Our CRS scores at the time were really low as we were both over 40. Mine was 413 and my husband’s was way less (I can’t remember the exact score but around 331 or so). At this point, we knew we had to pursue the option of going the PNP route.<br><br>We had to create a second Express Entry profile when our profiles expired after a year of not achieving much. Patience is indeed a virtue my people.<br><br><b>SINP (SASKATCHEWAN IMMIGRANT NOMINEE PROGRAM) NOMINATION</b><br>I was determined not to give up on this journey and God sent a good friend and sister of mine to me in September 2016. She told me about the SINP and added me to two WhatsApp groups. At that time, our NOCs were not included in their Occupation In-Demand list but there was a NOC we thought was close to my husband’s so we created two profiles (EE and OID-paper-based) and uploaded all necessary documents while waiting for the programs to open. We eventually submitted both that year/January 2017 and we were asked to choose one of the programs we wanted to be processed. We chose the SINP EE program and by May 2017, the application was rejected due to a wrong NOC. We prayed and hoped that one of our NOCs would be added to their OID list and thank God it happened sometime in August 2017 or so. My husband’s NOC was added to the list and we created a new profile and waited for the program to open for submission. <br><br>On October 26, 2017, we paid CAD300 and submitted the application. It was a very long wait of constantly checking the profile to see if there was any progress made. The application was in process until February 7, 2018 when we received ADR which we responded to on February 11, 2018. The status didn’t change from ‘waiting on applicant’ almost two months after we had responded to the ADR. Someone in one of the WhatsApp groups I joined, who also was in the same situation, mentioned that he sent an email to the Manager in charge of the program and got a reply that a decision had been made and he will hear from them soon. He got his letter of nomination that same day. I told my husband about it and after waiting for a while, we decided to follow suit. On April 3, 2018, we sent a very polite email stating that we had sent the additional documents requested for and there was no change in the status of the application. On April 6, 2018, at about a few minutes after 12am when I had just gone to bed <b>(worried that our IELTS reports would expire on April 30, 2018 i.e. in less than 4 weeks)</b>, my husband woke me up with the news of an update. I quickly got off my bed to check his profile and low and behold, it was our nomination letter. I rolled on the floor thanking God and asking Him to forgive me for doubting and almost giving up. I couldn’t sleep that night. I checked his Express Entry profile and found out that some parts of the profile had not been transmitted so I stayed up dotting the ‘I’s and crossing the ‘t’s. <br>I discovered that the EE profile number and job seeker validation code stated in the nomination letter were those of the expired EE profile and had to send them an email immediately requesting that they kindly issue a revised nomination letter with the current details which they did as soon as they resumed work.<br>We accepted the nomination that same day (April 6, 2018) and my husband’s CRS score jumped to 900 plus. <br><br><b>PCC</b><br>We contacted someone whom my friend and sister (the same one that added me to the SINP WhatsApp groups) introduced me to and went to Ikoyi on April 9, 2018 to get our PCCs done. It took about an hour and a half to get the PCCs for N5,000 each.<br><br><b>ITA</b><br>ITA came on April 11, 2018 (five days after SINP nomination) and it was another happy moment.<br><br>MEDICALS<br>I called IOM on April 16, 2018 and got an appointment for the next day. The process took about 3 hours from when they allowed us in at 8am. <br><br><b>POF</b><br>We had a joint investment account that we had opened in 2011 with more than the sum required for a family of 4 with a financial institution (not a bank but a CBN licensed FI). We were given a detailed letter and the statement of account stamped and signed.<br><br><b>WORK EXPERIENCE REFERENCE</b><br>My husband got a letter from his former colleague for two years of his last ten years of work experience (as the company was no longer in existence) and got reference letters from his clients for the remaining eight years. He also got his company’s bank statement and highlighted each payment made by each client on client by client basis. It was easier at this point because this had been done when we applied for the SINP nomination. He had 40 pages of bank statement to work on but thank God he did a good job. This was one thing he actively participated in throughout the process….LOL.<br>If you ever asked him about the EE and PNP process, he would tell you to ask his wife. He referred quite a number of people to me (he still does) and I was happy to help.<br><br><b>AOR</b><br>We submitted our application on April 23, 2018 <b>(7 days to the expiration of our IELTS reports)</b>. It was such a huge relief. <br><br><b>POST AOR</b><br>Medicals Passed – April 27, 2018.<br>We thought it was going to be a smooth and fast journey to PPR getting an update 4 days after AOR. Little did we know that we still had a long journey ahead of us. We had learnt patience and perseverance during the journey so far but this part of the long wait was even more frustrating to say the least.<br>We didn’t receive any update for the normal processing time (6 months). I kept checking the EE profile and my husband’s email account every other day (sometimes several times a day) but nothing changed. I knew about ordering the GCMS notes but we decided to be even more patient. <br>In November 2018, I filled the web form (I didn’t know the VO processing the application so I chose within Canada). We received an email notifying us of our VO, the notorious AVO! We immediately filled another Web form and AVO informed us that our application was in queue for review. We were discouraged by some friends in Canada from requesting for the GCMS notes in October but decided to do so in December when there was still no progress and AVO would not respond to our Web form. <br><br>At this point, while searching for another means of communication with AVO apart from the Web form, I stumbled upon this great Platform. I joined this platform on December 6, 2018 and asked how I could reach them apart from using the web form. <b>@abakiki</b> mentioned that I could send them an email (God bless you).<br><br>I ordered the GCMS notes in December 2018 and got it in January 2019. From the notes, the application had been transferred to AVO on May 17, 2018 after the last case analyst in CIO recommended a review of the lead statement, main duties and work experience but AVO had not touched the application since it was transferred to them. <br><br>I decided to check the EE profile less and take my mind off the matter though I somehow believed that one day it will end in praise. I was just not sure when the one day would be and prayed that it will happen before April when our Medical reports would expire.<br><br>I ordered another set of GCMS notes in January (my cousin helped with both orders) after submitting another web form to AVO and didn’t receive any response. On February 5, 2019, I decided to send an email to AVO (as advised by <b>@abakiki</b> in December) enquiring about the status of the application and politely informing them that our application had been in queue for review and we were unable to plan appropriately for the year. We received an automated reply almost immediately that they would respond shortly. About an hour later, there was an update on the EE profile (the first since April 27, 2018). We were requested to submit the following:<br>-Schedule A Form (PA and Spouse)<br>-Additional Family Information Form (PA and Spouse)<br>-Updated Proof of Settlement Funds<br><br>On February 7, 2019, I tried uploading the additional documents but one was too large so I decided to upload later that day after compressing the file. Before I had the chance to upload the documents, we received another update. I was so scared to sign in and check what it was. When I did, it was another request but this time, it was PPR!!! We didn’t know how to express our joy, relief, excitement and gratitude to God. We are truly grateful to God and thankful for all the people He sent our way while on this journey. We were way older than the ‘favourable’ age group but God made it happen. Do your part and leave the ‘how’ to God. His grace is sufficient for you.<br><br>Once again, a BIG THANK YOU to all of you who have been very magnanimous with your time and wealth of knowledge on this platform. Rest assured that your labour of love will be greatly rewarded. Though I joined this platform long after we had submitted our application, I was encouraged and sometimes entertained by the many posts and responses I got. It was great to celebrate with other PPR recipients while waiting for ours.<br><br><b>@ifeoma77</b>, I have noticed your dedication to helping people and I know that we will celebrate with you very soon by His grace. God bless you immensely.<br><br>I wish everyone who's still in the race, about starting or already a PR, God’s very best. Keep on moving…….<br><br>God bless you all.<br><br><br><br><br>   Pls dear can u add me to the what's app group.. 08171959286.Thanks and God bless u.<br><br></blockquote></div>",9:25am,Mar-02,2019

Your point is valid and I strongly agree with you.<br><br>Though I think you're misconstruing stuff here in your opening statement. Obviously, declining ITA several times is not ""cool"". But is an application extra scrutinized because the applicant declined ITA several times? No. Is it possible to decline ITA several times and not be penalized for it? Yes. That was the basis of the argument.<br><br>Also people, let's not forget that some people are oblivious that declining ITA affects others in the pool. It would be overly insensitive for someone who despite knowing this, proceeds to decline their ITA without regard or consideration for others. Last year, I declined my sister's ITA over a trivial reason that a one-page LOE could have fixed. I wasn't well informed then, but now I know better. This might just be the case with @johnnybravo1990.</blockquote>Bros the argument is that people who know that they have high score, should enter the pool when they are ready, not just entering and getting several ITAs, then declining as they like...thats not fair or considerate at all..thank you!</div>",2:24pm,Mar-03,2019

I did some research and then decided I think I want this, an amazing life for me and my kids. I told my baby ( my then bf , now hubby).. he wasn’t interested then o, said you can make it in naija, kinikan kinikan , hmmm . I tried to convince him then, I just said let me start first . Started my WES October 2017, wrote my ielts a month after( passed in one sitting).<br><br><b>WES</b> - Then I mistakenly or just mumuly decided to use nipost for WES just to buy time , maybe baby would agree, that’s how my village people caught up to me o and strike started . The up and down ehn , sorting people , spending money, Wes finally came through. <br><br><b>Work experience/CRS score</b> - Then the wait for 3 years experience nko as I just wanted to use one workplace to claim points. Finally it was complete, then another wait for crs to drop to 441... oh I forgot, Passport expired in between all of the above (after ielts though)<br><br><b>Passport matter</b> - Then the debate to wait and do court with change of name or just renew like that, by this time baby was already feeling the Canadian waka small small , he had gotten his Internationàl passport, even did ielts, he passed,but his score wasn’t up to mine(maxing out the ielts score )...<br><br><b>Single Or As a Couple</b> ? - Back to me doing this alone at first. So I said babe let’s do court na and apply as a couple, baby was like no o, everything is a process, I must propose, then do intro, then court can follow, I said babe hmm adding spouse in between is one kind o. But I can’t propose to my self abi or do court with myself, i sha continued.<br><br><b>ITA</b> - Well, ITA showed up,  I didn’t have issues with POF ( used First bank treasury bills, stanbic fixed deposit , stanbic money market investment funds), Alhamdulillah... I sha chilled till July, so I can add my love in between, so it won’t be too early .<br><br><b>AOR</b> - Hence my AOR July 1st, then the race began, constant profile checking, oh lest I forget , before this I met amazing people in our May ITA group , TEECAN , my brother Threemg(love you bro ), my sissy deesmama(AOR mate) and now close friend, we’re plenty small in that group and I hope our prayers would all be answered soonest.<br><br>I forgot to mention, baby proposed before I even got ITA, then we did a huge introduction ceremony and a small court wedding ceremony , all this while , my file was at Ottawa . Now it was time to add my hubby. Sent a mail, i got ADR, too many requests o, but we did it sha and submitted... they added my baby beginning of October or so..then I got IP2 some days after, Alhamdulillah, was so happy I buzzed deesmama straight that she should check her profile , she didn’t get that day, but got the next day and ppr the Monday afterwards... amazing period <br><br><b>The Wait</b> - Then the wait started, where’s ppr nah, everyone was getting ppr up and down , but the thing didn’t reach me... hmmm...called an agent , the guy was super rude , was just using me to catch cruise...<br>I called like 2 weeks after again then I heard the dreaded news, file was at Accra, I cried ehn, didn’t believe my ears, I told my bro straight @threemg, he said I should not worry, meanwhile I ordered gcms notes, as the first one refused to come (ended up getting here later)...when it finally came all was passed but a section called « other Reqs » showed not started, the type of check was non compliance check, mogbe.. I researched, checked canada visa forum, nothing, my worry was now in full force...<br><br><b>Accra VO gang</b> - Then I joined the Accra VO gang, I’m glad now that Accra VO is performing, there are rumors that they have a processing window of January till March, you might see a lot of PPRs from Accra this period.... I pray they extend this their window so at least they can attend to all, please release my people Abeg... . I Met a couple of friends and caring people in the group,I thought I was going to be depressed in the group, but the support was reassuring....anyways by this time I didn’t check nairaland again before I enter depression things.. @threemg added me to the group, then we all started surviving together...<br><br><b>Interview things</b> - Fast forward to January 14th, request for interview , both me and spouse had to attend, we also had to come with all evidence of our relationship from the onset and they gave us just 2 weeks to prepare.. Ahhhh gbese, called hubby straight , called my bro @threemg... and as you’ve already guessed, I cried ehn, tears couldn’t stop flowing, so many regrets, but I never regretted ever adding my baby, most of the regrets was all around maybe waiting till IP2 or after PPr or adding more documents or something sha..<br><br><i>I must say this, I’m quite pessimistic as well, that didn’t help me in this journey at all...please let’s be optimistic in this journey o, very important Abeg.</i><br><br>My story is long abi, hmm it hasn’t finished o, keep reading...<br><br><br><b>Interview Prep</b>- The documents gathering started, you know this modern day love na soft copies of pictures dey our phone, we used over 20k to print 200pictures... I went to airtel office for phone records between hubby and I, those ones used me to catch cruise too, said they could only give me 3 months worth of records, as a naija girl, i also applied at another office, so I could maybe get 6 months altogether, they caught me sha o ( but I still found a way out)... I took screenshots of our iMessage chats, we exported whatsapp chat, we printed hotel receipts of all our escapades, we printed pictures of gifts we ever gave each other that we snapped, what didn’t we get...hmm<br><br><br><b>The Interview ( Summary)</b><br><br>We took days off, we booked our flights, flew a day before , got in late at night to Accra, then we decided to eat something ( spaghetti and sauce), you see we thought it was familiar, what could be wrong right?.. well here goes, I couldn’t sleep well, I vomited the next morning, hubby was purging... ahh gbese...the devil can’t win naw, after we have come this far...<br><br>Meanwhile our Accra Gang they throway prayer for us, our interview gang too, my May ITA group too, my siblings, my friends.... their prayers were answered o .....<br><br>Interview went amazingly well... lady was nice, hmm... let me rest, would continue later...<br><br><br><i>Cont’d</i><br><br><br>Back to the matter!!<br><br>So we got to the embassy, right on time, they collected all phone, all wristwatches, most things sha, but I still went in with my bag after they searched thoroughly, we dropped our documents with the receptionists and held on to some other supporting docs. We could hear an interview going well, the lady ended up passing and was asked to either come the next day or submit her passports from Lagos. Kai we were happy for her o and gingered ....<br><br>At this time, just hubby and I were at the waiting room, we waited and waited o, they didn’t call us, I even dozed off small, finally after about 1hr 30mins of waiting... I was called, she apologized for the delay, such an amazing lady, she was nice as well... then the questions came o ( another story), highlight was that the interview was almost like a spousal sponsorship interview, i told her the truth, adding interesting information in between, she was just laughing, me sef laugh join...one thing was for sure I made sure all I said was the truth about our relationship, because hubby was next  and our answers at least had to match small.....<br><br><b>The Verdict</b> - Hubby’s turn, she asked almost the same things, it went well o.... then she asked hubby to call me, and then she told us the good news , that we passed , you need to see the way we jumped, then she said in that moment when I told you guys, I could see the love, mehn we beamed even more. She then asked when we were traveling, we said tonight, she said they can only stamp our passports and issue COPR tomorrow or we wait till we get back to lagos, hubby said when we get to lagos ..... sigh<br><br>Hmm, we sha told her thank you and left... I was happy and sad ( left to me , we go reschedule flight and collect our thing sharply next day), but hubby kept saying he had to go back, I cried and cried , kept wondering why he didn’t see the importance the way I did... hmmm... didn’t talk to him o... finally I couldn’t stand to see him feeling so bad, sha told him how I felt and we settled...<br><br>Off to lagos back, Shebi all is well that ends well, next day ppr mail entered, I was so freaking happy, called hubby straight, told my Accra and Interview gang, I sharply carry passport say make I go submit. Got to hubby’s car o, na so stomach pain start again( at this time I knew village people were really trying , but I also knew Allah was stronger than them)... hubby rushed me to the emergency room in the hospital o, took drip, hubby stayed with me for a while... then I went back home as I was cleared...<br><br><b>Then I submitted the next day...</b><br><br><br>I know my story is very long, I even missed out some part , so that people won’t get bored and to conceal my identity lol. This journey was something else...all my friends had gotten , people I put through, I knew the process to a large extent , why my journey was longer, I don’t know but I know Allah knows best ...<br><br>I didn’t call out advices, but I’m sure if you read my story well, you would have picked one or two...oh and if you find out you have an interview with your spouse due to addition or something, don’t be scared , you can also reach out to me...<br><br>I sincerely thank all my friends, my family, my newly made friends from whatsapp support groups, nairaland forum and friends made here.... without the support, I may have given up.<br><br>Now I pray for good health as we must get to our second country InshaAllah...<br><br>It ended in praise .

Also, I wasn't sure of when I was going to complete my POF; even now, I am not 100% sure.

I didn't want to take that chance, and so I declined quickly.<br>What I have resolved to do is this: for any ITA I get, I'll wait for 2-3 weeks, and if there is no hope of completing my POF soonest, I will decline.

Hubby fell out with him and used security agents to get his money back. <br><br>The issue now is, we do not know if the agent truly submitted anything in his name and was rejected.

I've been posting regular scores since (8,8.5) 35 to 39 but recently I dropped to 30-33 over the last five tests I've taken since Friday and I must have taken 20+ Listening tests since beginning of February. What could be the problem? Any tips. <br><br>I'm considering engaging Tuteria, anyone used them before for IELTS? I'm slated to write witg MOD on 6th April. </blockquote><br>I can imagine the frustration. I think if you figure out if there was any change that occurred between when you were doing great and when your scores dropped, you'd be able to readjust. It could be psychological. Stress, perhaps?<br><br>Asides trying my utmost best into paying absolute attention and shutting out distractions, what I also did during practice was to scan the next few questions (like 2-3 questions) to have an idea of what I thought the answers could be before the speaker(s) mention it. And then, I write down the answer as quick as possible and move on to the next questions. I know, it's not that easy. Sometimes, you'd think you're doing great because your focus on the audio is so good and suddenly, you get lost in thoughts and miss your way. It happens. Also, try not to let your previous low scores affect your next practice test, just as missing one question demoralizes a person and makes the person miss the next question. With constant practice, it gets easier and better. I'm not familiar with Tuteria, I'm sure someone will reply in that regard. <br>All the best bro! I hope this helps.</div>",2:38pm,Mar-05,2019

"<div class=""narrow"">PPR post alert from a silent reader.<br>Ps: we used an agent. <br><br>Decision to migrate was 2016<br>So hubby and I wrote ielts his score was LRWS- 8.5 7 7 8<br>Mine LRSW- 6.5 7 7.5 7<br>First attempt. He was the pa. We both have MSc from UK schools and Wes evaluation began. His nig school came thru but mine didn't which was delaying the verification so we finally deleted my BSc and evaluated just my MSc. <br>Crs-456<br>Then we dived into the pool(deep End)<br>ITA- 9th March <br>We ordered for our UK pc (mine was delayed don't know why, it finally came). We did the nig one. Did medicals at iom abuja ( I was in my 3 trimester and no harm to the baby). We did all these in the hope I'd put to bed in canny)God's plan ain't our plan). That we even already sold most of our property and almost sublet our house. <br>Pof ( we prepared for family of 3 in advance)- gift of deeds. Our wedding gift (Toyota highlander)from fil. So we sold it and made notary public for it. That's all we used for pof!<br>We sent all our reference letter and pay slip,marriage certificate,change of name,school certificate, etc.<br><br>AOR- April 20th <br>1st ADR- 26th April (schedule A form for both of us)<br>Then baby came. To God be the glory. Then we quickly went for her intl passport. Got to the immigration place. They said haa new born please go in quickly. Madam was just sleeping refused to wake up oo. One man said remove her socks and tickle her my daughter no answer. I screamed her name still no show. Till the man came to carry her ooo. And removed her two socks and did what he told me to. My daughter woke up with a big cry. Hehehehheh and they did her capture ( with a frown in her photo)When he handed her back to me  she continued her sleeping. <br>Then to add her Na became an issue. <br>That was when I came across nairaland living in canada. Twas from there I dropped my question and my friend on here that responded to my question directed me to Canadian migration Na so I join from part 4. <br><br>We sent a mail  (thanks to my sister niobemed that provided the email address)to notify them.From the mail we sent to Ottawa was when we knew our VO was London Office. Choi. They said we should send it to London office mail which we did. We sent all her details. LO said thanks for the mail we have gotten all her documents when we need more we will contact and thank you for making the mail short and brief. Lol. <br><br>We then finally paid half year's rent and bought some items back into the house and said mehn if this canny journey is for us it will come no matter what.<br><br>Then 2nd ADR  (24th of September)- request for my husband's statement of account showing his recent inflow of salary. He printed immediately and we sent back to them.<br><br>The wait continued o. Choi. Everyday we checked to see if our number of dependent had changed nothing. <br>Not until I saw a post I saw that the person called them to remind th it was 5 months that nothing showed. I say ahh I gats tell my husband to call oo. Plus the rain fall of the PPR sef gingered me. The night of the back to back PPR we rang them past 8pm nigerian time. It was automated machine that read what was on our profile back to us and they said all agents are busy. I said we will call them tomorrow. <br><br>16th October -On his way to his office he got the request mail to send her payments. We were so excited we called the agent to do the needful. We paid same day. Finally, her profile was included. Phew! <br>Yesterday (17th)we got ghost update. I already started packing and planning how we will do farewells to our families and friends. Of course I started composing my POST. <br>My husband called in sick today(18th) to monitor his mail box hehehehheh. <br>While I'm here proof reading my post.<br><br><br><br><br>From that 18th of October 2018 till today (05/03/19) was when the Golden mail got to us.

"<div class=""narrow"">True but I still think the scores will still drop. They will continue to fluctuate highs and lows. This happened in previous years. In 2017 for instance, the scores peaked to as high as 468 and 450s then dropped to 441 in Feb until Sept then peaked again in Nov to the 450s until March 2018, remaining consistent in the 440s throughout 2018. The scores were even much higher in 2016. Infact in the whole of 2018, there was never a 430 something until a surprise draw in January 2019 and the 438s got invited, who would have thought? <br><br>Of course it is safe to max out ielts and get prof. certs with increased job experience but there is HOPE.

"<div class=""narrow"">In addition to previous advice, see further corrections below:<br><br> Beware of contractions (I'm, you're etc). You over-used them. Try not to get used to them. I understand they are ok for informal letters, but many times, it is not easy to make the conscious switch from contractions to writing them in full when you have to write formal. Stick to non-contracted verb forms and it will work well for you in both formal and informal. The way you used them here would give the impression that you do not know how to use verbs in non-contracted forms. <br><br>How is the new job? (remove ""coming along"" )<br><br>""Platform"" is incorrect here, I think you mean ""location"" (maybe ""branch"" could also work)<br><br>Write MOD/IDP in full. If you are to use abbreviations, the first mention of it should be written in full. Subsequent mentions can be abbreviated.<br><br> Good points for using ""feverishly"" appropriately. Continue in that manner. Do not keep it simple. Use big grammar, but use it well. Show the examiner that you can write comfortably using uncommon words. <br><br>""writing"", W should not be in caps (or ""Writing Module"", so we know you are referring to a proper noun)<br><br>Your 3rd sentence, paragraph 2 is great. That is complex sentence (mixed with a question). Please write more sentences like this one.<br><br>I am assuming you meant ""halt"" not ""hilt"", but remove ""to a halt"", it sounds colloquial, just write ""you're busy""<br><br>Technically, ""targeting"" is correct. But it just does not sound nice when it is written. It sounds better when speaking (Mind you, you must be careful not to write exactly how you speak, some words/sentences sound great when you speak but less desirable when you write them). Maybe it is just me overthinking it. Personally, I would write ""I strongly desire a 7.5 score""<br><br>paper-based (with an hypen)<br><br>handwritten (in one word)/hand-written (Be careful of words like this)<br><br>""it's"", not ""its"" (the apostrophe makes all the difference in both words, again, avoid contractions if you can)<br><br>I think what you mean is ""electronic devices"", as against pen and paper. Keep in mind equal comparisons/weightings in comparative sentences.<br><br>Avoid simple sentences as much as you can. The last bolded parts could be rewritten as ""I hope you understand but I would make my handwriting as legible as possible, although it would take a great deal of effort on my part. I am really counting on you to assist me because this exam is a make or break test for me, especially since passing it would make my dreams of migrating to Canada come through.""  (flesh up your sentences so you can make them complex)<br><br>Your last sentence has a weird construction and is not good. You can rewrite it as ""I woud like to send you my practice tests on Whatsapp, however, if you consider it too personal or inconvenient, I can send it via email or other messaging platforms suggested by you"" (Note I ended the sentence with a passive noun clause). Combining different types of sentences proves to the reader that you have a good grasp of the language. Using transitional words transforms your sentences from basic to complex which would score you points. <br><br>This link has a great repertoire of transitional words which I still consult when I write in my job <a href=""http://writing2.richmond.edu/writing/wweb/trans1.html"">http://writing2.richmond.edu/writing/wweb/trans1.html</a><br><br>""Thanks a bunch"" is too colloquial even for spoken English.

Perhaps there are those who got 8.5/9 in writing that can give superior advice. Also, when practicing, target scoring 9 in all the modules and practice hard for those scores (lol, I used the word ""target"" ). Usually, we tend to score lower than what our targeted scores. If you practice hard for a 9, you might end up getting an 8.5 or 8 in writing.

"<div class=""narrow"">The responsibility for tax deduction as a full employee lies with your employer, not you. You would not be penalised if your employer does not make the necessary deductions. The issue with taxes in this process occurs mostly with self-employed individuals or freelancers who are required to file taxes themselves with the tax office. At least that is how their system works here (which the VO might bear in mind).<br><br>Also the issues I have seen with respect to taxes are those of inlanders because IRCC have access to their tax information, on request. They do not have the legal right to request yours as a foreigner to begin to investigate.<br><br> You do not need to worry.  But if it will give you peace of mind, you can write an LOE (although it is not necessary in my opinion.

"<div class=""narrow""><blockquote><a href=""/post/76507526""><b>ladymarshall</b></a>:<br>In addition to previous advice, see further corrections below:<br><br> Beware of contractions (I'm, you're etc). You over-used them. Try not to get used to them. I understand they are ok for informal letters, but many times, it is not easy to make the conscious switch from contractions to writing them in full when you have to write formal. Stick to non-contracted verb forms and it will work well for you in both formal and informal. The way you used them here would give the impression that you do not know how to use verbs in non-contracted forms. <br><br>How is the new job? (remove ""coming along"" )<br><br>""Platform"" is incorrect here, I think you mean ""location"" (maybe ""branch"" could also work)<br><br>Write MOD/IDP in full. If you are to use abbreviations, the first mention of it should be written in full. Subsequent mentions can be abbreviated.<br><br> Good points for using ""feverishly"" appropriately. Continue in that manner. Do not keep it simple. Use big grammar, but use it well. Show the examiner that you can write comfortably using uncommon words. <br><br>""writing"", W should not be in caps (or ""Writing Module"", so we know you are referring to a proper noun)<br><br>Your 3rd sentence, paragraph 2 is great. That is complex sentence (mixed with a question). Please write more sentences like this one.<br><br>I am assuming you meant ""halt"" not ""hilt"", but remove ""to a halt"", it sounds colloquial, just write ""you're busy""<br><br>Technically, ""targeting"" is correct. But it just does not sound nice when it is written. It sounds better when speaking (Mind you, you must be careful not to write exactly how you speak, some words/sentences sound great when you speak but less desirable when you write them). Maybe it is just me overthinking it. Personally, I would write ""I strongly desire a 7.5 score""<br><br>paper-based (with an hypen)<br><br>handwritten (in one word)/hand-written (Be careful of words like this)<br><br>""it's"", not ""its"" (the apostrophe makes all the difference in both words, again, avoid contractions if you can)<br><br>I think what you mean is ""electronic devices"", as against pen and paper. Keep in mind equal comparisons/weightings in comparative sentences.<br><br>Avoid simple sentences as much as you can. The last bolded parts could be rewritten as ""I hope you understand but I would make my handwriting as legible as possible, although it would take a great deal of effort on my part. I am really counting on you to assist me because this exam is a make or break test for me, especially since passing it would make my dreams of migrating to Canada come through.""  (flesh up your sentences so you can make them complex)<br><br>Your last sentence has a weird construction and is not good. You can rewrite it as ""I woud like to send you my practice tests on Whatsapp, however, if you consider it too personal or inconvenient, I can send it via email or other messaging platforms suggested by you"" (Note I ended the sentence with a passive noun clause). Combining different types of sentences proves to the reader that you have a good grasp of the language. Using transitional words transforms your sentences from basic to complex which would score you points. <br><br>This link has a great repertoire of transitional words which I still consult when I write in my job <a href=""http://writing2.richmond.edu/writing/wweb/trans1.html"">http://writing2.richmond.edu/writing/wweb/trans1.html</a><br><br>""Thanks a bunch"" is too colloquial even for spoken English. Just write ""Thanks in advance"" or ""Thanks very much"" or ""Thank you"".<br><br>Also, do not take punctuations for granted. There should be a comma in front of ""Dear friend"" and ""Best wishes"".<br><br>I got an 8 in writing, so this advice is not the best you can get. Perhaps there are those who got 8.5/9 in writing that can give superior advice. Also, when practicing, target scoring 9 in all the modules and practice hard for those scores (lol, I used the word ""target"" ). Usually, we tend to score lower than what our targeted scores. If you practice hard for a 9, you might end up getting an 8.5 or 8 in writing.  In addition, please spend more time, thought and mental energy practicing task 2 and write impeccably even during your practice tests. <br><br></blockquote><br><br>Kudos madam, please would you be willing to help critic my essays.

It was not an easy one.. I am not a woman of many words but I’l like to give back to the thread by sharing my journey.<br><br><b>PRE EXPRESS ENTRY</b><br>I heard about express entry from a colleague at work sometime in 2016, she told me how her brother and his wife migrated through the EE route to Canada, this immediately piqued my interest.<br>I discussed with my sister who lives in the US about Express Entry and she encouraged me to do some research on it, na so I enter google o! lol. While doing my findings I came across this awesome thread and started reading from part 1.  The wealth of information I got made me more and more interested in EE. I had wanted to start the process then but one thing held me back— (My then Boyfriend, Now Hubby) Anyways, I was not ready to embark on the journey on my own and I wasn’t sure I could survive staying so far away from my man. So I hinted him about EE and he was really supportive of the idea but said he was not ready to leave the country yet! HMM..  he encouraged me to start the process, but I knew I didn’t want to go alone.. so I stalled and didn’t do anything about EE; giving oga time to rethink his decision. Meanwhile, I kept on following the thread and seeing more and more people get PPR got me more determined to do this.<br> Fast forward to 2017… I decided to start the process with the mindset that “what will be, will be”<br><b>TIMELINE:</b><br>IELTS – 10/11/17<br>ECA -  16/11/17<br>AOR- 22/6/18 <br>MEP- 6/7/18<br>IP2 -- late July<br>Got married in August <br>ADR to add spouse-- 15/8/18<br>Submitted spouse docs -- 13/9/18<br>spouse UCI -- 14/9/18<br>1st Ghost Update - 26/10/18<br>ADR 2--- 10/1/19<br>2nd Ghost Update -- 7/3/19<br>PPR -- 8/3/19<br><br><b>ECA</b>—I chose WES to do my ECA and it took forever for me to get my transcript from IMSU.. my cousin who stays in owerri had to go back and forth my uni before they sent to WES. (God bless her for me), it took about 3months in total to complete the process. Eca Report was ready on November 16, 2017<br><br><b>IELTS</b> – while ECA was on-going, I registered and started preparing for ielts.. I concentrated more on writing and listening (especially map), materials I used were Ielts Liz, ielts mini and ielts advantage. Also watched a lot of youtube videos. IELTS result came out on November 10, 2017 -- LRWS –8.5,8,7.5,7.5<br><br>By the time WES report came on Nov 16th,  2017, I had missed the draw of November 15th, 2017 with cut off 439 …... My crs was 441 and the draws never came down to 441 till April  25th, 2018 ….I remember how disappointed I was whenever there was a draw but I was hopeful and it finally came down in April. Infact, I celebrated as if I received PPR on that day cos it took almost 5months waiting for ITA.<br><br><b>PCC</b> – I did my PCC for 5k at alagbon with Inspector Moshood.<br><br><b>MEDICALS</b> – I did my medicals at children’s practice, it was a horrible experience as the place was very rowdy with only 1 person attending to all the people there that day. I regretted using them and when it was time for hubby to do his, We chose Q-Life for him, he had a better experience than I did.<br><br><b>WORK REFERENCE</b>  - This was easy to get as my HR didn’t have any issues giving me a letter in CIC format.<br><br><b>POF</b> – 70% of Pof was in fixed deposit with 30% balance as gift deed from my Dad, so I submitted investment letter from bank, Bank letter in CIC format, notarized gift deed, statement of account and 6months payslips.<br><br>After submitting my Application then the wait began, constant checking of my profile and hoping I’d have a speedy timeline, little did I know I was in for a long wait.<br> Anyways, My babe and I got married  in August, I notified CIC the next week, no response from them, I had to send them reminders and raised CSEs till they finally responded giving us 30days to submit a list of forms, marriage cert, pcc,proof of relationship pics, questionnaires etc.<br>We put all the documents together as quickly as we could, provided lots of old pictures from when we started dating to trips we had taken together with family and friends to show our marriage wasn’t arrangee (babe and I have been together for 7years hence we had lots of proof. We submitted in September and then MORE silence.<br><br>On 10th the of October 2018, We ordered GCMS notes, we got a ghost update on the 26th of October and I started getting excited thinking PPR was close, for where! People were getting PPR left, right and center but it didn’t come near us o, hmm .. GCMS notes refused to come and we were in the dark not knowing what was going on with our application, then in November we decided to call CIC, it was hard getting to speak with any agent, we kept trying until it went through and I was given the shocker I had been dreading….. Our file was transferred to ACCRA VO and they didn’t have access to our file.. I was so sad after that call, knowing how Accra can be slow, I was moody for daysss guys, It was that bad, Hubby was quite confident that all was well.<br>By December we had completed 6months, hmm na so I begin bombard them with mails and CSEs, all we got were generic replies! It was so frustrating, all this while GCMS we ordered since October hadn’t arrived, followed up with GCMSbuddy and they kept responding that our notes had been marked as priority blablabla.. I was so upset at this time cos we couldn’t make any proper plans and everything was on hold.<br><br>January 10th I got a mail to check my account and it was ADR for spouse PCC and updated Schedule forms for both of us, I was happy, at least someone had picked up our file. Dear hubbs had to go to alagbon to re-do his PCC as the one we submitted earlier in September had exceeded 3months, we didn’t want to take chances.. we submitted ADR on the 13th of January and then silence again. Finally our GCMS notes came on the 25th of January since October.. I was sha relieved everything looked good. <br><br>Also in January, while waiting for PPR to come I decided to change my passport from maiden to my marital name so that my PR card won’t have different surname from hubby’s (personal decision tho), so I did passport change of name at Ikoyi for 45k, sent new passport to ACCRA with affidavit for change of name and they updated my profile to my marital name .<br> <br>Lots of delayed June applications started getting cleared in February and when the thing nor reach me, I followed up with mails and CSEs again oo yet nothing, So I sent ACCRA a short emotional mail on the 6th of march, finally got visited by another ghost update on the 7th!! I was so sure PPR was around the corner and then Finally on the 8th  of march, by 5:24pm I got an email to check my account.. I hurriedly Logged on and there it was sitting pretty!! The Golden mail!! I was ecstatic!<br> It Ended in Praise!!! Special thanks to the Almighty God for making my dream a reality!<br><br>Thank You to all you amazing people who take out your time to keep the thread alive! Thanks to the 2 amazing ladies who always responded to my mails @Glitteringstar and @Newmum0625 God bless You Guys!!<br><br>Passports were submitted today 11/3/19 at VFS. <br>I wish everyone waiting at any stage of your application a speedy timeline in Jesus name!

I am not a woman of many words but I’l like to give back to the thread by sharing my journey.<br><br><b>PRE EXPRESS ENTRY</b><br>I heard about express entry from a colleague at work sometime in 2016, she told me how her brother and his wife migrated through the EE route to Canada, this immediately piqued my interest.<br>I discussed with my sister who lives in the US about Express Entry and she encouraged me to do some research on it, na so I enter google o! lol. While doing my findings I came across this awesome thread and started reading from part 1.  The wealth of information I got made me more and more interested in EE. I had wanted to start the process then but one thing held me back— (My then Boyfriend, Now Hubby) Anyways, I was not ready to embark on the journey on my own and I wasn’t sure I could survive staying so far away from my man. So I hinted him about EE and he was really supportive of the idea but said he was not ready to leave the country yet! HMM..  he encouraged me to start the process, but I knew I didn’t want to go alone.. so I stalled and didn’t do anything about EE; giving oga time to rethink his decision. Meanwhile, I kept on following the thread and seeing more and more people get PPR got me more determined to do this.<br> Fast forward to 2017… I decided to start the process with the mindset that “what will be, will be”<br><b>TIMELINE:</b><br>IELTS – 10/11/17<br>ECA -  16/11/17<br>AOR- 22/6/18 <br>MEP- 6/7/18<br>IP2 -- late July<br>Got married in August <br>ADR to add spouse-- 15/8/18<br>Submitted spouse docs -- 13/9/18<br>spouse UCI -- 14/9/18<br>1st Ghost Update - 26/10/18<br>ADR 2--- 10/1/19<br>2nd Ghost Update -- 7/3/19<br>PPR -- 8/3/19<br><br><b>ECA</b>—I chose WES to do my ECA and it took forever for me to get my transcript from IMSU.. my cousin who stays in owerri had to go back and forth my uni before they sent to WES. (God bless her for me), it took about 3months in total to complete the process. Eca Report was ready on November 16, 2017<br><br><b>IELTS</b> – while ECA was on-going, I registered and started preparing for ielts.. I concentrated more on writing and listening (especially map), materials I used were Ielts Liz, ielts mini and ielts advantage. Also watched a lot of youtube videos. IELTS result came out on November 10, 2017 -- LRWS –8.5,8,7.5,7.5<br><br>By the time WES report came on Nov 16th,  2017, I had missed the draw of November 15th, 2017 with cut off 439 …... My crs was 441 and the draws never came down to 441 till April  25th, 2018 ….I remember how disappointed I was whenever there was a draw but I was hopeful and it finally came down in April. Infact, I celebrated as if I received PPR on that day cos it took almost 5months waiting for ITA.<br><br><b>PCC</b> – I did my PCC for 5k at alagbon with Inspector Moshood.<br><br><b>MEDICALS</b> – I did my medicals at children’s practice, it was a horrible experience as the place was very rowdy with only 1 person attending to all the people there that day. I regretted using them and when it was time for hubby to do his, We chose Q-Life for him, he had a better experience than I did.<br><br><b>WORK REFERENCE</b>  - This was easy to get as my HR didn’t have any issues giving me a letter in CIC format.<br><br><b>POF</b> – 70% of Pof was in fixed deposit with 30% balance as gift deed from my Dad, so I submitted investment letter from bank, Bank letter in CIC format, notarized gift deed, statement of account and 6months payslips.<br><br>After submitting my Application then the wait began, constant checking of my profile and hoping I’d have a speedy timeline, little did I know I was in for a long wait.<br> Anyways, My babe and I got married  in August, I notified CIC the next week, no response from them, I had to send them reminders and raised CSEs till they finally responded giving us 30days to submit a list of forms, marriage cert, pcc,proof of relationship pics, questionnaires etc.<br>We put all the documents together as quickly as we could, provided lots of old pictures from when we started dating to trips we had taken together with family and friends to show our marriage wasn’t arrangee (babe and I have been together for 7years hence we had lots of proof. We submitted in September and then MORE silence.<br><br>On 10th the of October 2018, We ordered GCMS notes, we got a ghost update on the 26th of October and I started getting excited thinking PPR was close, for where! People were getting PPR left, right and center but it didn’t come near us o, hmm .. GCMS notes refused to come and we were in the dark not knowing what was going on with our application, then in November we decided to call CIC, it was hard getting to speak with any agent, we kept trying until it went through and I was given the shocker I had been dreading….. Our file was transferred to ACCRA VO and they didn’t have access to our file.. I was so sad after that call, knowing how Accra can be slow, I was moody for daysss guys, It was that bad, Hubby was quite confident that all was well.<br>By December we had completed 6months, hmm na so I begin bombard them with mails and CSEs, all we got were generic replies! It was so frustrating, all this while GCMS we ordered since October hadn’t arrived, followed up with GCMSbuddy and they kept responding that our notes had been marked as priority blablabla.. I was so upset at this time cos we couldn’t make any proper plans and everything was on hold.<br><br>January 10th I got a mail to check my account and it was ADR for spouse PCC and updated Schedule forms for both of us, I was happy, at least someone had picked up our file. Dear hubbs had to go to alagbon to re-do his PCC as the one we submitted earlier in September had exceeded 3months, we didn’t want to take chances.. we submitted ADR on the 13th of January and then silence again. Finally our GCMS notes came on the 25th of January since October.. I was sha relieved everything looked good. <br><br>Also in January, while waiting for PPR to come I decided to change my passport from maiden to my marital name so that my PR card won’t have different surname from hubby’s (personal decision tho), so I did passport change of name at Ikoyi for 45k, sent new passport to ACCRA with affidavit for change of name and they updated my profile to my marital name .<br> <br>Lots of delayed June applications started getting cleared in February and when the thing nor reach me, I followed up with mails and CSEs again oo yet nothing, So I sent ACCRA a short emotional mail on the 6th of march, finally got visited by another ghost update on the 7th!! I was so sure PPR was around the corner and then Finally on the 8th  of march, by 5:24pm I got an email to check my account.. I hurriedly Logged on and there it was sitting pretty!! The Golden mail!! I was ecstatic!<br> It Ended in Praise!!! Special thanks to the Almighty God for making my dream a reality!<br><br>Thank You to all you amazing people who take out your time to keep the thread alive! Thanks to the 2 amazing ladies who always responded to my mails @Glitteringstar and @Newmum0625 God bless You Guys!!<br><br>Passports were submitted today 11/3/19 at VFS. <br>I wish everyone waiting at any stage of your application a speedy timeline in Jesus name!

"<div class=""narrow""><blockquote><a href=""/post/76595301""><b>marshall69</b></a>:<br>Again this write-up isn't for everybody, but I just thought it wise to share for those of you who might be in my shoes. Please excuse my typo, doing this with a bit of tiredness from work.<br><br>Unfortunately my Canada immigration pursuit has been truncated for now...NOT TRYING to DISCOURAGE anybody from immigrating to CANADA<br><br>I only started comtemplating to relocating out of the Nigeria on March 25th, 2016 after I had sensed in my spirit that God wanted me to leave Nigeria (again, I didn't say I heard God's voice oh!). Meanwhile I was working for a multi-national company in Lagos, salary was okay, bla bla but I never took any action towards relocating. <br><br>My belief is that God has a plan for me and I only want to go where He wants me to God, so for the next 1 and half years I was ruminating with the idea and checking my heart for peace. Eventually, I decided to move to Canada after it became clear that it was time for me to leave Nigeria in early 2018. I did the whole shebang - WES (BSc) &amp; IELTS. My first IELTS score was LRWS - 8,8.5,6.5,7.5 with a CRS 0f 376. <br><br>The application for my IELTS remark was denied and I only had the option to re-write the test inorder to boost my CRS score. I didn't have the morale/nudging to study for IELTS again, instead I had the convinction to start believing God for a job. Getting a job offer in Canada would go a long way in actualizing the dream, so I started checking with my company's Canadian offices if they had an opening for my role, but unfortunately someone was hired from our Mexico office to Toronto a few months before and the office didn't have any more slots. <br><br>Not long after, I found an internal job listing in one of our offices in Western Europe (decided not to mention the exact country becos I want to remain anonymous), after checking my heart if this is what God wants for me and discussing with some people I respect, I applied for the role. Did the interviews and got the job offer late last year. Finally moved/transferred to the new office in January this year.<br><br>My brothers &amp; sisters, I'm writing from this Strong western european country where I now live &amp; work. The company I work for practically took care of the costs from visa, air-travel. I also got a relocation allowance and even had the option to move my furnitures &amp; other house hold items with a sea &amp; air shipping company all expenses-paid. Did I mention that I'm also single with only a Nigeria BSc :-). Life for me here is great and I can work in this new country for as long as I want to. Weather is less colder than Canada and I can be back in MMA2 within 6-8 hours.<br><br>So what's the moral of the story? Again, this is not for everybody. So here it is - I could still be back in Nigeria wasting time trying to get to Canada, whereas God has already prepared a much better place for me here in this Strong Western Europe country. My parting comment - always check your heart for peace and be open minded to God. I'm not trying to discourage any body from chasing the Canada dream, all I'm saying be open to other options and enter your God given destiny.<br><br><br><br><br></blockquote><br>you sound familiar DA <img src=""https://www.nairaland.com/faces/smiley.png"" alt=""smiley"" border=""0"" class=""faces""></div>",6:49pm,Mar-12,2019

"<div class=""narrow"">Again this write-up isn't for everybody, but I just thought it wise to share for those of you who might be in my shoes. Please excuse my typo, doing this with a bit of tiredness from work.<br><br>Unfortunately my Canada immigration pursuit has been truncated for now...NOT TRYING to DISCOURAGE anybody from immigrating to CANADA<br><br>I only started comtemplating to relocating out of the Nigeria on March 25th, 2016 after I had sensed in my spirit that God wanted me to leave Nigeria (again, I didn't say I heard God's voice oh!). Meanwhile I was working for a multi-national company in Lagos, salary was okay, bla bla but I never took any action towards relocating. <br><br>My belief is that God has a plan for me and I only want to go where He wants me to God, so for the next 1 and half years I was ruminating with the idea and checking my heart for peace. Eventually, I decided to move to Canada after it became clear that it was time for me to leave Nigeria in early 2018. I did the whole shebang - WES (BSc) &amp; IELTS. My first IELTS score was LRWS - 8,8.5,6.5,7.5 with a CRS 0f 376. <br><br>The application for my IELTS remark was denied and I only had the option to re-write the test inorder to boost my CRS score. I didn't have the morale/nudging to study for IELTS again, instead I had the convinction to start believing God for a job. Getting a job offer in Canada would go a long way in actualizing the dream, so I started checking with my company's Canadian offices if they had an opening for my role, but unfortunately someone was hired from our Mexico office to Toronto a few months before and the office didn't have any more slots. <br><br>Not long after, I found an internal job listing in one of our offices in Western Europe (decided not to mention the exact country becos I want to remain anonymous), after checking my heart if this is what God wants for me and discussing with some people I respect, I applied for the role. Did the interviews and got the job offer late last year. Finally moved/transferred to the new office in January this year.<br><br>My brothers &amp; sisters, I'm writing from this Strong western european country where I now live &amp; work. The company I work for practically took care of the costs from visa, air-travel. I also got a relocation allowance and even had the option to move my furnitures &amp; other house hold items with a sea &amp; air shipping company all expenses-paid. Did I mention that I'm also single with only a Nigeria BSc :-). Life for me here is great and I can work in this new country for as long as I want to. Weather is less colder than Canada and I can be back in MMA2 within 6-8 hours.<br><br>So what's the moral of the story? Again, this is not for everybody. So here it is - I could still be back in Nigeria wasting time trying to get to Canada, whereas God has already prepared a much better place for me here in this Strong Western Europe country. My parting comment - always check your heart for peace and be open minded to God. I'm not trying to discourage any body from chasing the Canada dream, all I'm saying be open to other options and enter your God given destiny.</div>",5:37pm,Mar-12,2019

"<div class=""narrow"">I think it is a good idea to put in a couple of them so the examiner see that you know it. There are bigger issues to worry about though. Tone for instance, when you write a sentence like ""I have really missed you and our chitchat"", that is very informal even without the contractions. Another is issue-relevant vocabulary. The kind of language you use in describing your new house or new town is different from that of a movie or an insurance issue or flight issue etc <br><br>See this page<br><br><a href=""https://www.ieltsadvantage.com/2015/06/08/how-to-write-an-informal-ielts-letter/"">https://www.ieltsadvantage.com/2015/06/08/how-to-write-an-informal-ielts-letter/</a><br><br>If I were you, I would worry more about losing marks in Task 2 because it is about (or more than) 60% of your writing score. Remember the 80/20 principle.  Task 2 is always formal and sometimes task 1 can be formal, semi-formal or informal. There are greater chances of you writing formal than informal in IELTS writing.<br><br><br><blockquote><a href=""/post/76568694""><b>jerich</b></a>:<br><br><br>nice essay. please house, will one loose marks or get a low score if one does not use contractions like i'm , I've etc.For informal essay like the Above ? </blockquote></div>",10:05pm,Mar-11,2019

"<div class=""narrow""><b>MY PPR STORY</b><br><br>First of all I am so grateful to the Almighty God! It was not an easy one.. I am not a woman of many words but I’l like to give back to the thread by sharing my journey.<br><br><b>PRE EXPRESS ENTRY</b><br>I heard about express entry from a colleague at work sometime in 2016, she told me how her brother and his wife migrated through the EE route to Canada, this immediately piqued my interest.<br>I discussed with my sister who lives in the US about Express Entry and she encouraged me to do some research on it, na so I enter google o! lol. While doing my findings I came across this awesome thread and started reading from part 1.  The wealth of information I got made me more and more interested in EE. I had wanted to start the process then but one thing held me back— (My then Boyfriend, Now Hubby) Anyways, I was not ready to embark on the journey on my own and I wasn’t sure I could survive staying so far away from my man. So I hinted him about EE and he was really supportive of the idea but said he was not ready to leave the country yet! HMM..  he encouraged me to start the process, but I knew I didn’t want to go alone.. so I stalled and didn’t do anything about EE; giving oga time to rethink his decision. Meanwhile, I kept on following the thread and seeing more and more people get PPR got me more determined to do this.<br> Fast forward to 2017… I decided to start the process with the mindset that “what will be, will be”<br><b>TIMELINE:</b><br>IELTS – 10/11/17<br>ECA -  16/11/17<br>AOR- 22/6/18 <br>MEP- 6/7/18<br>IP2 -- late July<br>Got married in August <br>ADR to add spouse-- 15/8/18<br>Submitted spouse docs -- 13/9/18<br>spouse UCI -- 14/9/18<br>1st Ghost Update - 26/10/18<br>ADR 2--- 10/1/19<br>2nd Ghost Update -- 7/3/19<br>PPR -- 8/3/19<br><br><b>ECA</b>—I chose WES to do my ECA and it took forever for me to get my transcript from IMSU.. my cousin who stays in owerri had to go back and forth my uni before they sent to WES. (God bless her for me), it took about 3months in total to complete the process. Eca Report was ready on November 16, 2017<br><br><b>IELTS</b> – while ECA was on-going, I registered and started preparing for ielts.. I concentrated more on writing and listening (especially map), materials I used were Ielts Liz, ielts mini and ielts advantage. Also watched a lot of youtube videos. IELTS result came out on November 10, 2017 -- LRWS –8.5,8,7.5,7.5<br><br>By the time WES report came on Nov 16th,  2017, I had missed the draw of November 15th, 2017 with cut off 439 …... My crs was 441 and the draws never came down to 441 till April  25th, 2018 ….I remember how disappointed I was whenever there was a draw but I was hopeful and it finally came down in April. Infact, I celebrated as if I received PPR on that day cos it took almost 5months waiting for ITA.<br><br><b>PCC</b> – I did my PCC for 5k at alagbon with Inspector Moshood.<br><br><b>MEDICALS</b> – I did my medicals at children’s practice, it was a horrible experience as the place was very rowdy with only 1 person attending to all the people there that day. I regretted using them and when it was time for hubby to do his, We chose Q-Life for him, he had a better experience than I did.<br><br><b>WORK REFERENCE</b>  - This was easy to get as my HR didn’t have any issues giving me a letter in CIC format.<br><br><b>POF</b> – 70% of Pof was in fixed deposit with 30% balance as gift deed from my Dad, so I submitted investment letter from bank, Bank letter in CIC format, notarized gift deed, statement of account and 6months payslips.<br><br>After submitting my Application then the wait began, constant checking of my profile and hoping I’d have a speedy timeline, little did I know I was in for a long wait.<br> Anyways, My babe and I got married  in August, I notified CIC the next week, no response from them, I had to send them reminders and raised CSEs till they finally responded giving us 30days to submit a list of forms, marriage cert, pcc,proof of relationship pics, questionnaires etc.<br>We put all the documents together as quickly as we could, provided lots of old pictures from when we started dating to trips we had taken together with family and friends to show our marriage wasn’t arrangee (babe and I have been together for 7years hence we had lots of proof. We submitted in September and then MORE silence.<br><br>On 10th the of October 2018, We ordered GCMS notes, we got a ghost update on the 26th of October and I started getting excited thinking PPR was close, for where! People were getting PPR left, right and center but it didn’t come near us o, hmm .. GCMS notes refused to come and we were in the dark not knowing what was going on with our application, then in November we decided to call CIC, it was hard getting to speak with any agent, we kept trying until it went through and I was given the shocker I had been dreading….. Our file was transferred to ACCRA VO and they didn’t have access to our file.. I was so sad after that call, knowing how Accra can be slow, I was moody for daysss guys, It was that bad, Hubby was quite confident that all was well.<br>By December we had completed 6months, hmm na so I begin bombard them with mails and CSEs, all we got were generic replies! It was so frustrating, all this while GCMS we ordered since October hadn’t arrived, followed up with GCMSbuddy and they kept responding that our notes had been marked as priority blablabla.. I was so upset at this time cos we couldn’t make any proper plans and everything was on hold.<br><br>January 10th I got a mail to check my account and it was ADR for spouse PCC and updated Schedule forms for both of us, I was happy, at least someone had picked up our file. Dear hubbs had to go to alagbon to re-do his PCC as the one we submitted earlier in September had exceeded 3months, we didn’t want to take chances.. we submitted ADR on the 13th of January and then silence again. Finally our GCMS notes came on the 25th of January since October.. I was sha relieved everything looked good. <br><br>Also in January, while waiting for PPR to come I decided to change my passport from maiden to my marital name so that my PR card won’t have different surname from hubby’s (personal decision tho), so I did passport change of name at Ikoyi for 45k, sent new passport to ACCRA with affidavit for change of name and they updated my profile to my marital name .<br> <br>Lots of delayed June applications started getting cleared in February and when the thing nor reach me, I followed up with mails and CSEs again oo yet nothing, So I sent ACCRA a short emotional mail on the 6th of march, finally got visited by another ghost update on the 7th!! I was so sure PPR was around the corner and then Finally on the 8th  of march, by 5:24pm I got an email to check my account.. I hurriedly Logged on and there it was sitting pretty!! The Golden mail!! I was ecstatic!<br> It Ended in Praise!!! Special thanks to the Almighty God for making my dream a reality!<br><br>Thank You to all you amazing people who take out your time to keep the thread alive!

"<div class=""narrow""><span style=""color:#000099;"">Guysssss!!!!<br><br><br><b>THE EAGLE HAS LANDED!!!!!<br><br><br>ISSA GOLDEN MAIL THINGS!!!<br><br>Here is my “brief story”… read at your own risk:</b><br><br>I have always believed that someday I would relocate fully out of Nigeria… whether it was for studies or something.. I just knew that my place was not this Naija. This was some years back.<br>Well, in 2011… when I was writing my ICAN, I had made friends with a couple of colleagues (also writing) the exam with me. One of them gave me some hints that he really wanted to leave Naija soon.. but never told me how. I also never bothered to ask. <br>I lost his contact, but got it back in 2014, only for me to see the kind of “abroad” pictures he was posting. I was like, “hope you are enjoying your vacation ooo” and he was like… “ Nooo.. this is not a vacation! I live here”<br>O boy!! That was how my ear/antennae just stood up ooo… I started interrogating him like an FBI agent… I asked him about the immigration process and how he went about it. He simply just sent me a link to read up on…. And that was the end. I was demotivated even before reading it properly. That was how I gave up on the idea.<br>In 2016, I stumbled on Australian immigration information and followed it gracefully. I gathered all the necessary information I needed and saved on my system. Good thing is that, I have never been that person to embark on a journey without thoroughly researching and asking myself very tough questions. I was so ready to embark on it… but did not have the funds. Well, the issue was not even the funds per se, but the fact that when I informed my parents about it, they totally kicked against it. Their argument was that, Aussie was too far and it would make me forget Naija. My relatives also added to this perspective, with examples of my distant cousins that had gone to Aussie many years ago but had not returned. I was completely discouraged and let this phase slide again.<br>After the above incidences, I had now decided to face my “Nigerian fate”… and so focused solely on my work and all. <br>In December 2017, while going home with one of the staff of my clients, she kept asking me about my career, what I intended to do in the medium to the long term etc. I kept downloading my plans passionately to her. I kept emphasizing on the professional exams I was set out to do, how I looked forward to growing through the career ladder in Nigeria and so on…. If only I had known that all those plans discouraged her from telling me about the Canada immigration EE process, I probably would have kept quiet. She told me later after I had commenced the process, that she wanted to tell me about the EE process, but seeing how passionate I was about the “Nigerian Plans” made her hold that key information back.<br>Well, fast forward to April 2018, while working at the office, I overheard one of my close friends/colleague telling another colleague about the EE immigration process and how he had gotten his Visa and bought his ticket ahead of his exit in August 2018. Immediately I heard that, I interjected, then asked him to brief me on the full information. Funny enough, the person he was telling was acting uninterested back then despite informing him about the process since far back 2017.<br>Well, as a sharp guy who had been looking for such an opportunity, I asked him what it would entail… and he gave me a brief highlight based on his knowledge about it. I was not satisfied with what he told me, so went ahead to research on it myself. That was when I stumbled on this thread and decided to feed on it like it was breakfast and Lunch. I dwelt there for days reading from the past information and PPR stories (days of Dupyshoo and Zandora etc). Then I knew I had to commence immediately.<br>However, I remember clearly that when my friend told me about the associated financial commitment for a single applicant, my heart sank… as I wondered how I would have been able to finalize my POF. But God came through for me.<br>I registered immediately for my IELTS in April to be written in May… and immediately sent my B.Sc and ACCA transcript (membership certificate) to Wes for evaluation.<br><br><b>IELTS</b><br>First IELTS was written in May: Lost out in Listening as I had 7.5 (BC)<br>Second IETLS was written on 7 July: LSRW – 8.5, 8.5, 7, 7 (BC)<br>Prior to the first IELTS, I had practiced a bit, but was slightly over confident because I felt that it was just a simple test of English which shouldn’t have been a problem at all for me. I however practiced the maps for a whole day using YouTube, and became a master in it as I was not failing any questions on maps anymore. Unfortunately, maps did not come out in the first exam.<br>When the result came out that morning, I was not happy with myself, but I told myself that I would channel all that efforts to scheduling for another exam.  I was reading negative comments all over the place, on groups and so on… especially people that did not pass the exams like me… but I shut out those thoughts to avoid being discouraged.<br>Immediately the next day came, I quickly scheduled for another, raised the draft of N75,000 and paid to BC. I thought that this would motivate me to read ooo… but boy!! My work wouldn’t allow me. There was absolutely no time at all. The night before the exam, I just skimmed through some lines and slept off… went for the exam the next day… and the rest, they say, is history!<br><br><b>Educational Credential Assessment</b><br>I used the conventional WES for my ECA… and it was a smooth ride. Luckily for me, they were not requesting for WAEC then. <br>So I reached out to my school to send my transcript (which took just between 14 – 21 working days) and to ACCA which took 14 working days. Also, note that I commenced the ECA transcript transmission alongside my preparation for IELTS. I also sent my B.Sc. and ACCA membership certificates to WES via Hellofax.<br>My WES report came out on 19 June 2018 with a summary of “2 or more degrees”. This was a complete breeze. In fact, I didn’t have to reach out to them for any information or complaints.<br><br><b>ITA</b><br> As at 20th July, 2018… I had my IELTS result and ECA ready… but did not dive into the pool because of my funds were not completely in the state I wanted it. I had to wait for some more funds before diving. I had a score of 468, so I was certain that I would get ITA once I dived. So I made up my mind to patiently wait till I was ready. <br>I had timed September 5 as my chosen ITA date… so I entered the pool on September 1. I got ITA and was so excited. It felt so surreal. Immediately, I swung to action and started to follow up with all necessary documentation.<br><br><b>Post ITA</b><br>i.  <b>PCC</b><br>This was a breeze. In fact, I had gotten a contact from my friend that told me about the EE process, I called the person a day before I went there. I took a one-hour break during my lunch time at work, went to their office asking of the Police officer I spoke to a day earlier. That was when I realized the guy had retired. However, the person he told me to ask of, happened to be his successor. The finger prints were taken, all the necessary things were done, price was negotiated to my desired 5k, then I picked up my completed PCC and headed back to work. I was happy!<br>I scanned the pink copy along with the finger printed copy and merged both together using my Adobe Acrobat. I attached the document to the PCC place holder<br><br>ii. <b>Passport photograph</b><br>This was snapped a day before I did the PCC at LUTH. I also got the contact from my friend. I ensured to take both soft and hard copy of the pictures before leaving the place. I ensured that the pictures were well measured in my presence in line with CIC requirements. The guy was experienced on CIC requirements, so it was hassle free exercise. The price was also very reasonable.<br>I attached the soft copy version to the placeholder in my EE profile.<br><br>iii. <b>Educational Certificates</b><br>As usual, I merged my University B.Sc Certificate with my ACCA membership certificate, ECA report and IELTS report using Adobe Acrobat. I attached the merged documents to the relevant placeholder in my App. I used Nigeria as the ACCA location, as this was where I wrote the exam.<br><br>iv. <b>International Passport and travel documents</b><br>This was also scanned and attached to the relevant placeholder.<br><br>V. <b>Medical Assessment</b><br>This was where I faced my second challenge through the EE process. I attempted to go through the normal route like everyone. Called IOM, Children’s Practice and Q-life to book… Lo and behold, the prices of IOM and Children’s practices were ridiculously high, so I took them completely off my list. Unfortunately, Qlife that was fairly priced, was booked till about October 20 something. I knew that I couldn’t wait till then, so I had to device a quick alternative. Then the idea of gate crashing came to my mind.<br>The next day, I left my house very early, arrived there before 7 am and wrote my name down. I thought it was that automatic. Well, after such a long wait till about 8:30, the tests commenced. However, before they commenced, they separated those that had booked from those that had not, just like me… I was disheartened. They told us to go to the reception to book our test dates. Upon arriving there, the receptionist recognized my name and tried to confirm why I had come earlier than the supposedly booked date of 20 something. I immediately pleaded with her, and told her that I had received ITA, and need to do it urgently as it was time bound. She empathized with me and decided to reschedule me for the next day.<br>I was so excited and did not worry about the lost time for the day. I came to the hospital the next day (19 September 2018) for the test. All was completed and results were fine.<br>I just scanned the up-front medical slip and attached to the relevant placeholder in my application.<br><br>vi. <b>Proof of Funds (POF)</b><br>This was gathered overtime but ready long before my ITA. My complete POF was ready by August as I had to sell my car to make up the outstanding balance. It was so saddening as I began to trek and my mobility reduced drastically. Infact when I was to sell the car, I had my fair share of challenges.<br>The car dealer I gave to sell the car on my behalf suddenly claimed that one of the most important vehicle documents was missing, the Customs document. I was so shattered. How on earth could this get missing? Did I forget it when I went to make photocopies? Or was the dealer trying to play a smart one on me?? Those were few of the numerous thoughts I had. Unfortunately, I didn’t have a single copy of the document and potential buyers were not in any way willing to risk purchasing the car without these document, despite its clean physical outlook. At the end of the day I had to part with some substantial sum of money to get another one from Customs.<br>Well, I sold it, added it to the funds I previously had and placed all in a Fixed Deposit (FD) investment split into 70% (due in 6 months) and 30% due in 1 year. I ensured that the bank clearly stated that “the funds could be retrieved at will”… and the fact that only a percentage of the interest would be affected and not the principal sum that was booked.<br>I scanned the FD certificate, merged it with a screenshot of foreign exchange for CAD to Naira on October 4, a certificate of non-indebtedness and my 25% pension (for the purpose of fluctuations in exchange). I merged these documents and attached in the relevant placeholder.<br><br>vii. <b>Reference Letter</b><br>This was another slightly shaky area. I actually thought that it would be a walk in the park, but how wrong I was. I obtained a reference letter from one of my past places of employment where I had spent 3 years, but felt the need to go the extra mile to obtain same from my current place of employment. This was because I felt they might have still asked. Getting the 3 year reference letter in CIC format from my past place of employment was not difficult at all. However, getting reference letter from my current place of employment where I had spent almost 2 years was now challenging. <br>Now, considering that I had not really stayed long in this place, I was skeptical about letting them know about my immigration plans, so I sent a mail to our HR to prepare the letter in CIC format. But they refused and insisted I obtained the necessary approval from my unit head, which would mean me letting the cat out of the bag so soon. My unit head was out of the country, so I had to wait till my unit head arrived before obtaining the approval. We had a deep concerted discussion where I explained that I had considered immigrating because of my long term plans. Approval was eventually granted and the required reference letter n CIC format was provided. However, this made me delay my submission to October 4.<br>I merged my 2 reference letters only and attached to the relevant placeholders. I did not attach pay slips because the reference letters alone were completely aligned to CIC format.<br><br><b>AOR &amp; Post AOR</b><br>I eventually submitted my application on October 4 at 11:55 pm. I paid for the application fee but not the RPRF as I did not have the funds as at then. 28 days after, I got the Medicals Passed (MEP) notification and biometrics request. I went immediately the next day to do my biometrics.<br>The wait then started. <br>On December 3, I then decided to pay my RPRF unsolicited. No RPRF mail was sent to me, I just went to CIC website, paid and attached the downloaded receipt to a CSE (alongside my now rolled over FD certificate) and sent to them. <br>I was determined to wait it out, all the way, at least till 4 months before knowing my visa office, but the pressure around me wouldn’t let me be. So, I sent a follow-up CSE reminder to confirm if the RPRF receipts and FD roll over certificates had been transmitted to my visa office. I also included my request to know my Visa office in the same mail. The response came a day after, where I was informed that it was Ottawa. I was so excited.<br>The wait continued….<br>On 6th January I ordered my GCMS notes as I had not seen a single ghost update (Casper) unlike others. It arrived on 1st week of February, and I realized when I read through it, that only criminality was passed. Eligibility and Security had not started. I was so downcast by this recent development, but friends around cheered me up. <br>I kept the hopes alive but kept getting even more emotionally drained as the days faded by and as my CIC time bar crawled closer to the deadline day. What even added to this mental stress was seeing new applications in November and December getting PPRs before me. Wow! Lots of thoughts started to flood through my head. Did I do something wrong?? Did I offend anybody?? What was the problem actually??<br>Every time I opened my CIC account, there was no single update in my account whatsoever. Casper (the ghost) was indeed not friendly to me. I became a ghost hunter and praying every day for ghosts in my account. All to no avail. I was distraught and discouraged from even opening my account as I just felt it would be the same thing, however, I would say a silent prayer, for God to bring my turn closer.<br>Days went by, and it became less than 30 days to go. I felt it was due time for me to order my second GCMS notes. I mentioned it in the WhatsApp group I was on, and people encouraged me to go ahead. Some people also encouraged me to follow it through with a call, which I sluggishly accepted. I ordered the notes on 6th March… then attempted calling CIC on 7th March, but it did not go through. I temporarily gave up. On 8th March, I just felt the motivation to call again, with very little expectation. My waiting time was about 5 mins. When the voice at the other end rang, it made me shudder slightly. Well I downloaded all my details to her in response to her questions and followed it through with a question about the status of my profile.<br>Lo and behold!, She told me that my file was just approved on the 7th (the day before). I thought I didn’t hear her clearly… Lol.   I had to ask her if she was sure about what she said and she reiterated her statement, with more audacity. My hand immediately started shaking, then I thanked her and went off the line. I still took the information I got from the call with a pinch of salt, because I was yet to see any ghost update like other people would usually get before PPR.<br>Well, I just decided to check my profile after the call… Lo and behold! My first ghost update since I submitted my application. I was so excited.<br>And today, PPR!<br>Glory be to God!!!!<br><br><b><i>In a nutshell, my timelines are below:<br>7 July, 2018 - IELTS – LSRW (8.5, 8.5, 7,7)<br>19 June, 2018 – ECA report arrived (2 or more degrees)<br>5 September, 2018 – ITA<br>4 October 2018 – AOR<br>8 March 2019 – Ghost Update (Casper, the friendly ghost)<br>12 March 2019 – PPR<br><br>Single Applicant</i></b><br><br>… and it has finally ended in praise!!!

One of them gave me some hints that he really wanted to leave Naija soon.. but never told me how. I also never bothered to ask. <br>I lost his contact, but got it back in 2014, only for me to see the kind of “abroad” pictures he was posting. I was like, “hope you are enjoying your vacation ooo” and he was like… “ Nooo.. this is not a vacation! I live here”<br>O boy!! That was how my ear/antennae just stood up ooo… I started interrogating him like an FBI agent… I asked him about the immigration process and how he went about it. He simply just sent me a link to read up on…. And that was the end. I was demotivated even before reading it properly. That was how I gave up on the idea.<br>In 2016, I stumbled on Australian immigration information and followed it gracefully. I gathered all the necessary information I needed and saved on my system. Good thing is that, I have never been that person to embark on a journey without thoroughly researching and asking myself very tough questions. I was so ready to embark on it… but did not have the funds. Well, the issue was not even the funds per se, but the fact that when I informed my parents about it, they totally kicked against it. Their argument was that, Aussie was too far and it would make me forget Naija. My relatives also added to this perspective, with examples of my distant cousins that had gone to Aussie many years ago but had not returned. I was completely discouraged and let this phase slide again.<br>After the above incidences, I had now decided to face my “Nigerian fate”… and so focused solely on my work and all. <br>In December 2017, while going home with one of the staff of my clients, she kept asking me about my <br></span></blockquote></div>",6:11am,Mar-12,2019

It was not an easy one.. I am not a woman of many words but I’l like to give back to the thread by sharing my journey.<br><br><b>PRE EXPRESS ENTRY</b><br>I heard about express entry from a colleague at work sometime in 2016, she told me how her brother and his wife migrated through the EE route to Canada, this immediately piqued my interest.<br>I discussed with my sister who lives in the US about Express Entry and she encouraged me to do some research on it, na so I enter google o! lol. While doing my findings I came across this awesome thread and started reading from part 1.  The wealth of information I got made me more and more interested in EE. I had wanted to start the process then but one thing held me back— (My then Boyfriend, Now Hubby) Anyways, I was not ready to embark on the journey on my own and I wasn’t sure I could survive staying so far away from my man. So I hinted him about EE and he was really supportive of the idea but said he was not ready to leave the country yet! HMM..  he encouraged me to start the process, but I knew I didn’t want to go alone.. so I stalled and didn’t do anything about EE; giving oga time to rethink his decision. Meanwhile, I kept on following the thread and seeing more and more people get PPR got me more determined to do this.<br> Fast forward to 2017… I decided to start the process with the mindset that “what will be, will be”<br><b>TIMELINE:</b><br>IELTS – 10/11/17<br>ECA -  16/11/17<br>AOR- 22/6/18 <br>MEP- 6/7/18<br>IP2 -- late July<br>Got married in August <br>ADR to add spouse-- 15/8/18<br>Submitted spouse docs -- 13/9/18<br>spouse UCI -- 14/9/18<br>1st Ghost Update - 26/10/18<br>ADR 2--- 10/1/19<br>2nd Ghost Update -- 7/3/19<br>PPR -- 8/3/19<br><br><b>ECA</b>—I chose WES to do my ECA and it took forever for me to get my transcript from IMSU.. my cousin who stays in owerri had to go back and forth my uni before they sent to WES. (God bless her for me), it took about 3months in total to complete the process. Eca Report was ready on November 16, 2017<br><br><b>IELTS</b> – while ECA was on-going, I registered and started preparing for ielts.. I concentrated more on writing and listening (especially map), materials I used were Ielts Liz, ielts mini and ielts advantage. Also watched a lot of youtube videos. IELTS result came out on November 10, 2017 -- LRWS –8.5,8,7.5,7.5<br><br>By the time WES report came on Nov 16th,  2017, I had missed the draw of November 15th, 2017 with cut off 439 …... My crs was 441 and the draws never came down to 441 till April  25th, 2018 ….I remember how disappointed I was whenever there was a draw but I was hopeful and it finally came down in April. Infact, I celebrated as if I received PPR on that day cos it took almost 5months waiting for ITA.<br><br><b>PCC</b> – I did my PCC for 5k at alagbon with Inspector Moshood.<br><br><b>MEDICALS</b> – I did my medicals at children’s practice, it was a horrible experience as the place was very rowdy with only 1 person attending to all the people there that day. I regretted using them and when it was time for hubby to do his, We chose Q-Life for him, he had a better experience than I did.<br><br><b>WORK REFERENCE</b>  - This was easy to get as my HR didn’t have any issues giving me a letter in CIC format.<br><br><b>POF</b> – 70% of Pof was in fixed deposit with 30% balance as gift deed from my Dad, so I submitted investment letter from bank, Bank letter in CIC format, notarized gift deed, statement of account and 6months payslips.<br><br>After submitting my Application then the wait began, constant checking of my profile and hoping I’d have a speedy timeline, little did I know I was in for a long wait.<br> Anyways, My babe and I got married  in August, I notified CIC the next week, no response from them, I had to send them reminders and raised CSEs till they finally responded giving us 30days to submit a list of forms, marriage cert, pcc,proof of relationship pics, questionnaires etc.<br>We put all the documents together as quickly as we could, provided lots of old pictures from when we started dating to trips we had taken together with family and friends to show our marriage wasn’t arrangee (babe and I have been together for 7years hence we had lots of proof. We submitted in September and then MORE silence.<br><br>On 10th the of October 2018, We ordered GCMS notes, we got a ghost update on the 26th of October and I started getting excited thinking PPR was close, for where! People were getting PPR left, right and center but it didn’t come near us o, hmm .. GCMS notes refused to come and we were in the dark not knowing what was going on with our application, then in November we decided to call CIC, it was hard getting to speak with any agent, we kept trying until it went through and I was given the shocker I had been dreading….. Our file was transferred to ACCRA VO and they didn’t have access to our file.. I was so sad after that call, knowing how Accra can be slow, I was moody for daysss guys, It was that bad, Hubby was quite confident that all was well.<br>By December we had completed 6months, hmm na so I begin bombard them with mails and CSEs, all we got were generic replies! It was so frustrating, all this while GCMS we ordered since October hadn’t arrived, followed up with GCMSbuddy and they kept responding that our notes had been marked as priority blablabla.. I was so upset at this time cos we couldn’t make any proper plans and everything was on hold.<br><br>January 10th I got a mail to check my account and it was ADR for spouse PCC and updated Schedule forms for both of us, I was happy, at least someone had picked up our file. Dear hubbs had to go to alagbon to re-do his PCC as the one we submitted earlier in September had exceeded 3months, we didn’t want to take chances.. we submitted ADR on the 13th of January and then silence again. Finally our GCMS notes came on the 25th of January since October.. I was sha relieved everything looked good. <br><br>Also in January, while waiting for PPR to come I decided to change my passport from maiden to my marital name so that my PR card won’t have different surname from hubby’s (personal decision tho), so I did passport change of name at Ikoyi for 45k, sent new passport to ACCRA with affidavit for change of name and they updated my profile to my marital name .<br> <br>Lots of delayed June applications started getting cleared in February and when the thing nor reach me, I followed up with mails and CSEs again oo yet nothing, So I sent ACCRA a short emotional mail on the 6th of march, finally got visited by another ghost update on the 7th!! I was so sure PPR was around the corner and then Finally on the 8th  of march, by 5:24pm I got an email to check my account.. I hurriedly Logged on and there it was sitting pretty!! The Golden mail!! I was ecstatic!<br> It Ended in Praise!!! Special thanks to the Almighty God for making my dream a reality!<br><br>Thank You to all you amazing people who take out your time to keep the thread alive! Thanks to the 2 amazing ladies who always responded to my mails @Glitteringstar and @Newmum0625 God bless You Guys!!<br><br>Passports were submitted today 11/3/19 at VFS. <br>I wish everyone waiting at any stage of your application a speedy timeline in Jesus name!

I was like, “hope you are enjoying your vacation ooo” and he was like… “ Nooo.. this is not a vacation! I live here”<br>O boy!! That was how my ear/antennae just stood up ooo… I started interrogating him like an FBI agent… I asked him about the immigration process and how he went about it. He simply just sent me a link to read up on…. And that was the end. I was demotivated even before reading it properly. That was how I gave up on the idea.<br>In 2016, I stumbled on Australian immigration information and followed it gracefully. I gathered all the necessary information I needed and saved on my system. Good thing is that, I have never been that person to embark on a journey without thoroughly researching and asking myself very tough questions. I was so ready to embark on it… but did not have the funds. Well, the issue was not even the funds per se, but the fact that when I informed my parents about it, they totally kicked against it. Their argument was that, Aussie was too far and it would make me forget Naija. My relatives also added to this perspective, with examples of my distant cousins that had gone to Aussie many years ago but had not returned. I was completely discouraged and let this phase slide again.<br>After the above incidences, I had now decided to face my “Nigerian fate”… and so focused solely on my work and all. <br>In December 2017, while going home with one of the staff of my clients, she kept asking me about my career, what I intended to do in the medium to the long term etc. I kept downloading my plans passionately to her. I kept emphasizing on the professional exams I was set out to do, how I looked forward to growing through the career ladder in Nigeria and so on…. If only I had known that all those plans discouraged her from telling me about the Canada immigration EE process, I probably would have kept quiet. She told me later after I had commenced the process, that she wanted to tell me about the EE process, but seeing how passionate I was about the “Nigerian Plans” made her hold that key information back.<br>Well, fast forward to April 2018, while working at the office, I overheard one of my close friends/colleague telling another colleague about the EE immigration process and how he had gotten his Visa and bought his ticket ahead of his exit in August 2018. Immediately I heard that, I interjected, then asked him to brief me on the full information. Funny enough, the person he was telling was acting uninterested back then despite informing him about the process since far back 2017.<br>Well, as a sharp guy who had been looking for such an opportunity, I asked him what it would entail… and he gave me a brief highlight based on his knowledge about it. I was not satisfied with what he told me, so went ahead to research on it myself. That was when I stumbled on this thread and decided to feed on it like it was breakfast and Lunch. I dwelt there for days reading from the past information and PPR stories (days of Dupyshoo and Zandora etc). Then I knew I had to commence immediately.<br>However, I remember clearly that when my friend told me about the associated financial commitment for a single applicant, my heart sank… as I wondered how I would have been able to finalize my POF. But God came through for me.<br>I registered immediately for my IELTS in April to be written in May… and immediately sent my B.Sc and ACCA transcript (membership certificate) to Wes for evaluation.<br><br><b>IELTS</b><br>First IELTS was written in May: Lost out in Listening as I had 7.5 (BC)<br>Second IETLS was written on 7 July: LSRW – 8.5, 8.5, 7, 7 (BC)<br>Prior to the first IELTS, I had practiced a bit, but was slightly over confident because I felt that it was just a simple test of English which shouldn’t have been a problem at all for me. I however practiced the maps for a whole day using YouTube, and became a master in it as I was not failing any questions on maps anymore. Unfortunately, maps did not come out in the first exam.<br>When the result came out that morning, I was not happy with myself, but I told myself that I would channel all that efforts to scheduling for another exam.  I was reading negative comments all over the place, on groups and so on… especially people that did not pass the exams like me… but I shut out those thoughts to avoid being discouraged.<br>Immediately the next day came, I quickly scheduled for another, raised the draft of N75,000 and paid to BC. I thought that this would motivate me to read ooo… but boy!! My work wouldn’t allow me. There was absolutely no time at all. The night before the exam, I just skimmed through some lines and slept off… went for the exam the next day… and the rest, they say, is history!<br><br><b>Educational Credential Assessment</b><br>I used the conventional WES for my ECA… and it was a smooth ride. Luckily for me, they were not requesting for WAEC then. <br>So I reached out to my school to send my transcript (which took just between 14 – 21 working days) and to ACCA which took 14 working days. Also, note that I commenced the ECA transcript transmission alongside my preparation for IELTS. I also sent my B.Sc. and ACCA membership certificates to WES via Hellofax.<br>My WES report came out on 19 June 2018 with a summary of “2 or more degrees”. This was a complete breeze. In fact, I didn’t have to reach out to them for any information or complaints.<br><br><b>ITA</b><br> As at 20th July, 2018… I had my IELTS result and ECA ready… but did not dive into the pool because of my funds were not completely in the state I wanted it. I had to wait for some more funds before diving. I had a score of 468, so I was certain that I would get ITA once I dived. So I made up my mind to patiently wait till I was ready. <br>I had timed September 5 as my chosen ITA date… so I entered the pool on September 1. I got ITA and was so excited. It felt so surreal. Immediately, I swung to action and started to follow up with all necessary documentation.<br><br><b>Post ITA</b><br>i.  <b>PCC</b><br>This was a breeze. In fact, I had gotten a contact from my friend that told me about the EE process, I called the person a day before I went there. I took a one-hour break during my lunch time at work, went to their office asking of the Police officer I spoke to a day earlier. That was when I realized the guy had retired. However, the person he told me to ask of, happened to be his successor. The finger prints were taken, all the necessary things were done, price was negotiated to my desired 5k, then I picked up my completed PCC and headed back to work. I was happy!<br>I scanned the pink copy along with the finger printed copy and merged both together using my Adobe Acrobat. I attached the document to the PCC place holder<br><br>ii. <b>Passport photograph</b><br>This was snapped a day before I did the PCC at LUTH. I also got the contact from my friend. I ensured to take both soft and hard copy of the pictures before leaving the place. I ensured that the pictures were well measured in my presence in line with CIC requirements. The guy was experienced on CIC requirements, so it was hassle free exercise. The price was also very reasonable.<br>I attached the soft copy version to the placeholder in my EE profile.<br><br>iii. <b>Educational Certificates</b><br>As usual, I merged my University B.Sc Certificate with my ACCA membership certificate, ECA report and IELTS report using Adobe Acrobat. I attached the merged documents to the relevant placeholder in my App. I used Nigeria as the ACCA location, as this was where I wrote the exam.<br><br>iv. <b>International Passport and travel documents</b><br>This was also scanned and attached to the relevant placeholder.<br><br>V. <b>Medical Assessment</b><br>This was where I faced my second challenge through the EE process. I attempted to go through the normal route like everyone. Called IOM, Children’s Practice and Q-life to book… Lo and behold, the prices of IOM and Children’s practices were ridiculously high, so I took them completely off my list. Unfortunately, Qlife that was fairly priced, was booked till about October 20 something. I knew that I couldn’t wait till then, so I had to device a quick alternative. Then the idea of gate crashing came to my mind.<br>The next day, I left my house very early, arrived there before 7 am and wrote my name down. I thought it was that automatic. Well, after such a long wait till about 8:30, the tests commenced. However, before they commenced, they separated those that had booked from those that had not, just like me… I was disheartened. They told us to go to the reception to book our test dates. Upon arriving there, the receptionist recognized my name and tried to confirm why I had come earlier than the supposedly booked date of 20 something. I immediately pleaded with her, and told her that I had received ITA, and need to do it urgently as it was time bound. She empathized with me and decided to reschedule me for the next day.<br>I was so excited and did not worry about the lost time for the day. I came to the hospital the next day (19 September 2018) for the test. All was completed and results were fine.<br>I just scanned the up-front medical slip and attached to the relevant placeholder in my application.<br><br>vi. <b>Proof of Funds (POF)</b><br>This was gathered overtime but ready long before my ITA. My complete POF was ready by August as I had to sell my car to make up the outstanding balance. It was so saddening as I began to trek and my mobility reduced drastically. Infact when I was to sell the car, I had my fair share of challenges.<br>The car dealer I gave to sell the car on my behalf suddenly claimed that one of the most important vehicle documents was missing, the Customs document. I was so shattered. How on earth could this get missing? Did I forget it when I went to make photocopies? Or was the dealer trying to play a smart one on me?? Those were few of the numerous thoughts I had. Unfortunately, I didn’t have a single copy of the document and potential buyers were not in any way willing to risk purchasing the car without these document, despite its clean physical outlook. At the end of the day I had to part with some substantial sum of money to get another one from Customs.<br>Well, I sold it, added it to the funds I previously had and placed all in a Fixed Deposit (FD) investment split into 70% (due in 6 months) and 30% due in 1 year. I ensured that the bank clearly stated that “the funds could be retrieved at will”… and the fact that only a percentage of the interest would be affected and not the principal sum that was booked.<br>I scanned the FD certificate, merged it with a screenshot of foreign exchange for CAD to Naira on October 4, a certificate of non-indebtedness and my 25% pension (for the purpose of fluctuations in exchange). I merged these documents and attached in the relevant placeholder.<br><br>vii. <b>Reference Letter</b><br>This was another slightly shaky area. I actually thought that it would be a walk in the park, but how wrong I was. I obtained a reference letter from one of my past places of employment where I had spent 3 years, but felt the need to go the extra mile to obtain same from my current place of employment. This was because I felt they might have still asked. Getting the 3 year reference letter in CIC format from my past place of employment was not difficult at all. However, getting reference letter from my current place of employment where I had spent almost 2 years was now challenging. <br>Now, considering that I had not really stayed long in this place, I was skeptical about letting them know about my immigration plans, so I sent a mail to our HR to prepare the letter in CIC format. But they refused and insisted I obtained the necessary approval from my unit head, which would mean me letting the cat out of the bag so soon. My unit head was out of the country, so I had to wait till my unit head arrived before obtaining the approval. We had a deep concerted discussion where I explained that I had considered immigrating because of my long term plans. Approval was eventually granted and the required reference letter n CIC format was provided. However, this made me delay my submission to October 4.<br>I merged my 2 reference letters only and attached to the relevant placeholders. I did not attach pay slips because the reference letters alone were completely aligned to CIC format.<br><br><b>AOR &amp; Post AOR</b><br>I eventually submitted my application on October 4 at 11:55 pm. I paid for the application fee but not the RPRF as I did not have the funds as at then. 28 days after, I got the Medicals Passed (MEP) notification and biometrics request. I went immediately the next day to do my biometrics.<br>The wait then started. <br>On December 3, I then decided to pay my RPRF unsolicited. No RPRF mail was sent to me, I just went to CIC website, paid and attached the downloaded receipt to a CSE (alongside my now rolled over FD certificate) and sent to them. <br>I was determined to wait it out, all the way, at least till 4 months before knowing my visa office, but the pressure around me wouldn’t let me be. So, I sent a follow-up CSE reminder to confirm if the RPRF receipts and FD roll over certificates had been transmitted to my visa office. I also included my request to know my Visa office in the same mail. The response came a day after, where I was informed that it was Ottawa. I was so excited.<br>The wait continued….<br>On 6th January I ordered my GCMS notes as I had not seen a single ghost update (Casper) unlike others. It arrived on 1st week of February, and I realized when I read through it, that only criminality was passed. Eligibility and Security had not started. I was so downcast by this recent development, but friends around cheered me up. <br>I kept the hopes alive but kept getting even more emotionally drained as the days faded by and as my CIC time bar crawled closer to the deadline day. What even added to this mental stress was seeing new applications in November and December getting PPRs before me. Wow! Lots of thoughts started to flood through my head. Did I do something wrong?? Did I offend anybody?? What was the problem actually??<br>Every time I opened my CIC account, there was no single update in my account whatsoever. Casper (the ghost) was indeed not friendly to me. I became a ghost hunter and praying every day for ghosts in my account. All to no avail. I was distraught and discouraged from even opening my account as I just felt it would be the same thing, however, I would say a silent prayer, for God to bring my turn closer.<br>Days went by, and it became less than 30 days to go. I felt it was due time for me to order my second GCMS notes. I mentioned it in the WhatsApp group I was on, and people encouraged me to go ahead. Some people also encouraged me to follow it through with a call, which I sluggishly accepted. I ordered the notes on 6th March… then attempted calling CIC on 7th March, but it did not go through. I temporarily gave up. On 8th March, I just felt the motivation to call again, with very little expectation. My waiting time was about 5 mins. When the voice at the other end rang, it made me shudder slightly. Well I downloaded all my details to her in response to her questions and followed it through with a question about the status of my profile.<br>Lo and behold!, She told me that my file was just approved on the 7th (the day before). I thought I didn’t hear her clearly… Lol.   I had to ask her if she was sure about what she said and she reiterated her statement, with more audacity. My hand immediately started shaking, then I thanked her and went off the line. I still took the information I got from the call with a pinch of salt, because I was yet to see any ghost update like other people would usually get before PPR.<br>Well, I just decided to check my profile after the call… Lo and behold! My first ghost update since I submitted my application. I was so excited.<br>And today, PPR!<br>Glory be to God!!!!<br><br><b><i>In a nutshell, my timelines are below:<br>7 July, 2018 - IELTS – LSRW (8.5, 8.5, 7,7)<br>19 June, 2018 – ECA report arrived (2 or more degrees)<br>5 September, 2018 – ITA<br>4 October 2018 – AOR<br>8 March 2019 – Ghost Update (Casper, the friendly ghost)<br>12 March 2019 – PPR<br><br>Single Applicant</i></b><br><br>… and it has finally ended in praise!!!

I was completely discouraged and let this phase slide again.<br>After the above incidences, I had now decided to face my “Nigerian fate”… and so focused solely on my work and all. <br>In December 2017, while going home with one of the staff of my clients, she kept asking me about my career, what I intended to do in the medium to the long term etc. I kept downloading my plans passionately to her. I kept emphasizing on the professional exams I was set out to do, how I looked forward to growing through the career ladder in Nigeria and so on….

I also sent my B.Sc. and ACCA membership certificates to WES via Hellofax.<br>My WES report came out on 19 June 2018 with a summary of “2 or more degrees”. This was a complete breeze. In fact, I didn’t have to reach out to them for any information or complaints.<br><br><b>ITA</b><br> As at 20th July, 2018… I had my IELTS result and ECA ready… but did not dive into the pool because of my funds were not completely in the state I wanted it. I had to wait for some more funds before diving. I had a score of 468, so I was certain that I would get ITA once I dived. So I made up my mind to patiently wait till I was ready. <br>I had timed September 5 as my chosen ITA date… so I entered the pool on September 1. I got ITA and was so excited. It felt so surreal. Immediately, I swung to action and started to follow up with all necessary documentation.<br><br><b>Post ITA</b><br>i.  <b>PCC</b><br>This was a breeze. In fact, I had gotten a contact from my friend that told me about the EE process, I called the person a day before I went there. I took a one-hour break during my lunch time at work, went to their office asking of the Police officer I spoke to a day earlier. That was when I realized the guy had retired. However, the person he told me to ask of, happened to be his successor. The finger prints were taken, all the necessary things were done, price was negotiated to my desired 5k, then I picked up my completed PCC and headed back to work. I was happy!<br>I scanned the pink copy along with the finger printed copy and merged both together using my Adobe Acrobat. I attached the document to the PCC place holder<br><br>ii. <b>Passport photograph</b><br>This was snapped a day before I did the PCC at LUTH. I also got the contact from my friend. I ensured to take both soft and hard copy of the pictures before leaving the place. I ensured that the pictures were well measured in my presence in line with CIC requirements. The guy was experienced on CIC requirements, so it was hassle free exercise. The price was also very reasonable.<br>I attached the soft copy version to the placeholder in my EE profile.<br><br>iii. <b>Educational Certificates</b><br>As usual, I merged my University B.Sc Certificate with my ACCA membership certificate, ECA report and IELTS report using Adobe Acrobat. I attached the merged documents to the relevant placeholder in my App. I used Nigeria as the ACCA location, as this was where I wrote the exam.<br><br>iv. <b>International Passport and travel documents</b><br>This was also scanned and attached to the relevant placeholder.<br><br>V. <b>Medical Assessment</b><br>This was where I faced my second challenge through the EE process. I attempted to go through the normal route like everyone. Called IOM, Children’s Practice and Q-life to book… Lo and behold, the prices of IOM and Children’s practices were ridiculously high, so I took them completely off my list. Unfortunately, Qlife that was fairly priced, was booked till about October 20 something. I knew that I couldn’t wait till then, so I had to device a quick alternative. Then the idea of gate crashing came to my mind.<br>The next day, I left my house very early, arrived there before 7 am and wrote my name down. I thought it was that automatic. Well, after such a long wait till about 8:30, the tests commenced. However, before they commenced, they separated those that had booked from those that had not, just like me… I was disheartened. They told us to go to the reception to book our test dates. Upon arriving there, the receptionist recognized my name and tried to confirm why I had come earlier than the supposedly booked date of 20 something. I immediately pleaded with her, and told her that I had received ITA, and need to do it urgently as it was time bound. She empathized with me and decided to reschedule me for the next day.<br>I was so excited and did not worry about the lost time for the day. I came to the hospital the next day (19 September 2018) for the test. All was completed and results were fine.<br>I just scanned the up-front medical slip and attached to the relevant placeholder in my application.<br><br>vi. <b>Proof of Funds (POF)</b><br>This was gathered overtime but ready long before my ITA. My complete POF was ready by August as I had to sell my car to make up the outstanding balance. It was so saddening as I began to trek and my mobility reduced drastically. Infact when I was to sell the car, I had my fair share of challenges.<br>The car dealer I gave to sell the car on my behalf suddenly claimed that one of the most important vehicle documents was missing, the Customs document. I was so shattered. How on earth could this get missing? Did I forget it when I went to make photocopies? Or was the dealer trying to play a smart one on me?? Those were few of the numerous thoughts I had. Unfortunately, I didn’t have a single copy of the document and potential buyers were not in any way willing to risk purchasing the car without these document, despite its clean physical outlook. At the end of the day I had to part with some substantial sum of money to get another one from Customs.<br>Well, I sold it, added it to the funds I previously had and placed all in a Fixed Deposit (FD) investment split into 70% (due in 6 months) and 30% due in 1 year. I ensured that the bank clearly stated that “the funds could be retrieved at will”… and the fact that only a percentage of the interest would be affected and not the principal sum that was booked.<br>I scanned the FD certificate, merged it with a screenshot of foreign exchange for CAD to Naira on October 4, a certificate of non-indebtedness and my 25% pension (for the purpose of fluctuations in exchange). I merged these documents and attached in the relevant placeholder.<br><br>vii. <b>Reference Letter</b><br>This was another slightly shaky area. I actually thought that it would be a walk in the park, but how wrong I was. I obtained a reference letter from one of my past places of employment where I had spent 3 years, but felt the need to go the extra mile to obtain same from my current place of employment. This was because I felt they might have still asked. Getting the 3 year reference letter in CIC format from my past place of employment was not difficult at all. However, getting reference letter from my current place of employment where I had spent almost 2 years was now challenging. <br>Now, considering that I had not really stayed long in this place, I was skeptical about letting them know about my immigration plans, so I sent a mail to our HR to prepare the letter in CIC format. But they refused and insisted I obtained the necessary approval from my unit head, which would mean me letting the cat out of the bag so soon. My unit head was out of the country, so I had to wait till my unit head arrived before obtaining the approval. We had a deep concerted discussion where I explained that I had considered immigrating because of my long term plans. Approval was eventually granted and the required reference letter n CIC format was provided. However, this made me delay my submission to October 4.<br>I merged my 2 reference letters only and attached to the relevant placeholders. I did not attach pay slips because the reference letters alone were completely aligned to CIC format.<br><br><b>AOR &amp; Post AOR</b><br>I eventually submitted my application on October 4 at 11:55 pm. I paid for the application fee but not the RPRF as I did not have the funds as at then. 28 days after, I got the Medicals Passed (MEP) notification and biometrics request. I went immediately the next day to do my biometrics.<br>The wait then started. <br>On December 3, I then decided to pay my RPRF unsolicited. No RPRF mail was sent to me, I just went to CIC website, paid and attached the downloaded receipt to a CSE (alongside my now rolled over FD certificate) and sent to them. <br>I was determined to wait it out, all the way, at least till 4 months before knowing my visa office, but the pressure around me wouldn’t let me be. So, I sent a follow-up CSE reminder to confirm if the RPRF receipts and FD roll over certificates had been transmitted to my visa office. I also included my request to know my Visa office in the same mail. The response came a day after, where I was informed that it was Ottawa. I was so excited.<br>The wait continued….<br>On 6th January I ordered my GCMS notes as I had not seen</div>",10:46am,Mar-12,2019

However, if you have statement of result, WES would accept that.<br>What of you get a photocopy of the lost degree certificate and certify it in court. Add police extract for lost item and then write to IQAS for reconsideration.<br>Or travel to your school in Ghana and get them to issue some kind of letter acknowledging your studies even in the absence of a replacement certificate?<br><br>On the other hand, you can use your ECA report like that and add LOE to explain the lack of a certificate.

"<div class=""narrow"">Its PPPPPPPPPPRRRRRR!!!!!!!<br>All Glory to God on High!!!!!<br>LONG POST ALERT!!!!<br>For those that can’t read long texts…..<br>Timeline<br>IELTS by BC -8777. 7th     July 2018<br>ECA by WES - 4th   Sept 2018<br>ITA - 4th Sept 2018<br>MED/PPC—18th Sept 2018<br>AOR-5th Oct 2018<br>BIL -2nd Nov 2018<br>Biometrics-5th Nov 2018<br>Expected PPR--- 5th Dec 2018<br>PPR---- 12th March 2019, dated 11th<br>Visa Office—Still unknown<br>Family of 2!!!!<br>155 days!!!<br><br>So, I am wishing I had written this long before the mail….            8:45am March 12th 2019<br><b>Post PPR</b> <br>Seating at the back seat of a Hilux, strapped in, Enroute Benin, laptop on my laps, I am just beaming while typing this …….story, no… reality. So, my last night was like chaos for me. Got home 10:45pm from the office as I was preparing documents that will be needed for the trip till 9:15pm. Meanwhile, as I got home….entered the Kitchen immediately, my other job. Had to fix a soup for my Husband to eat in my 4 days absence. By the time I was done, it was past 12. My darling Husband looked at me, and said….He cannot imagine I still had all the strength to arrange all this…….bla bla….long story short, We slept late, like past 2, cos after dinner/bfast we watched TV to allow the food digest. While preparing and stuffs; We just discussed how we were going to call the Lawyer in charge of our house and pay up our rent. We had waited for a notice since January, as rent was due Feb 14th, but no word. So we decided to call. My Husband had called him yesterday, but for some reasons, it was moved till today. We had just concluded to pay a year’s rent just incase he doesn’t agree to 6 months and if the PPR comes later than expected. Meanwhile, our visa expires in September, So we are planning till July/August to leave. It has all been a ball of confusion while waiting for the golden mail. So now, obviously, whether the Lawyer likes it or not….We are paying him the 6 months !!!! That’s the first testimony! <br><br>PRE CANADA<br>My neighbour told me about express entry way back in 2016! He said, that I am lucky, that his own application wa paper based and has been more than a year. He sent me the link ….I studied all through the pages. Then, I wasn’t married, I had finished my masters and currently working. That was when I had the Canadian dream. If you caught me day dreaming, I was somewhere in Vancouver, or Toronto…In fact I created a note book which I called “my Canada book”. I took notes and dreamed big. I had calculated the cost of living as well as my salary as an Intern Architect. It was quite impressive, and kept my dream alive. Somewhere during my research, I had read, one has to be married for at least one year to claim married. That’s how I suspended it, as I was preparing to get married in September that year. <br>So, fast forward to 2017 February, I had started a 14 months course that distracted me. In between,after the 1 year , It came up again, My Husband has been sceptical about the whole migration thingy. I cant remember what happened that month, but he began to reconsider. I brought out my “Canada book” Did a fresh research, things had change, IELTS was no more 52k, Was now’ 68k. I tabled the whole cost of processing it and all. The sum was enormous…Till I mentioned the Proof of Funds…..Then it was officially suspended again. The conclusion was that we can apply to visit once in a while, Lets make it here; Nigeria has a big avenue for progress and growth.<br>April 2018, Course ended…What project was next? Canada<img src=""/faces/huh.png"" style=""width:15px;height:22px;""> Yay!!!! <br>So I assured my Husband, that it’s the best thing to do. He had a friend that had relocated since 2011, his friend also encouraged him to come. …That’s how We began our journey.<br>PRE ITA<br>ECA: Registered with WES, my friend that had left since 2016, was a darling. I told her that we have finally decided to begin. And I was having issues paying WES with my debit card. That was how she asked my for my sign in details, and made the payments for me…Just like that! I started wondering how someone can be so carefree, deep down, I was even scared to send her the money to do it for me, to avoid stories that touch But she suggested to do it anyways…I paid to her Naija account 65k. <br>Then I knew I needed just the master. Went to Unilag, I was told I could do it online, that was cool. Since I had just come already, I gave one lady at Eco bank the application to process. Cost was 19500. 1k for her data….That one pained me o. Then I went to EPS behind Ecobank to courier my photocopy of Certificate. I was given 2 prices..N1500 (5 weeks), N16000 (5 days). I thought it through; then went for the N1500. In like a moth, my Certificate was received, but transcript still pending. That how I started going to Unilag to push them to send my transcript. I was always busy, so couldn’t be a regular. Then it was received, then verification came ….as August drew near, I started panicking and pushing my cousin to disturb them to verify. Anyways, God came through as usual.. I got a notification that it will be redy by 4th of September. I started my profile ahead and waited for the ITA.<br><b>IELTS</b>: In all honesty, I never really practiced. I had the notion that, it was just English, how difficult can it be? I had studied about the sections, what goes on where, how to talk, what to listen to….Most of the times, I read in the car, on my way to work, sample letters, examples of speaking topics, what to say etc. My Speaking Test was topic was “CONCENTRATION” . It wasn’t funny at all. I stammered, and was confused why I will have a topic like that. Common…Who asks anyone “What’s the effect of concentration on people in the City?” After the Test, I started hinting my Husband that it wasn’t as I had expected it o. First, I was shocked to see an elderly black man as my Test giver. The man looked li a Ghanaian, and I know Naija and Ghana beef. I just prayed it was going to be okay. A day to the other exam, the only day I had to practice; I quickly went to deliver an errand at my In-law’s place….that how I watched two movies (that I have watched before o) Got home around past 9, and went to bed. Woke up early, and glanced through my phone again for points and ideas. Centre was at Oregun, See crowd!! I was dumbfounded. As I only knew myself, I just faced my front, and was attentive throughout. Though the test was delayed for two hours, that part wasn’t funny. Results came out to the Glory of God, 8,7,7,7! I had not come across this thread yet, and also never knew the way IELTS can humble someone, I can only assume that If I had known that IELTS is a fail able test; I would have failed out of panic. It was much later that my friend told me that I was lucky, that she wrote it 5 times, the last she had to go to Abeokuta as Lagos wasn’t working for her. I thank God it went well. Immediately, I knew my score, as I had calculated with it. CRS 442. <br>I apologize for those offended with my exceeding thanks to God, but in all things I give thanks to God.<br>My Birthday is September 16th. I had calculated the forecast of ITAs to September 5. And was waiting for my ECA to drop since July 2018. With my Husband’s ECA, it was 452. So I registered his. By then, Unilag has increased the transcript to 25k, and the postal to N2500. I didn’t know about Hello fax by then. And up till now, Unilag cannot trace my Husband’s result. So, my chances was to hope ECA drops before 5th, if not the next ITA will be 19th (Husband’s birthday) and I would have lost 5 points down to 437. Then 440s was the real deal. I just turned to God and prayed. I have created a profile and submitted without the ECA , it made the profile ineligible. I had to create another, then waited. As God will have it, ECA dropped September 4, as promised….I dived into the pool @ 442!!!<br><br><b>POST ITA</b><br>This is where I found nairaland. My friend had sent me a link, I cant remember what for, But I found myself on a page with so much information, I saved it on my phone home screen. That as how I knew what to do when I get to Children’s Practice, gor ASP Moshood number, Knew places for passport photo, saw samples of reference letter. I started following up from when Mepconsultant got his PPR and people were arguing or so. Anyways, What annoys me while I read on to even this part is how basic questions that google can answer is being asked here. I got all the information form Page 1 of Part 5. Its appalling that one will claim to be a “graduate” who did “thesis” or “project” and also have above 3.5m, but cannot, I mean cannot research on a life changing journey; ;like as if One is being forced to go to Canada. …Lemme not deviate.<br><b>Reference Letters</b>:<br>I claimed 3 jobs. 1. Nysc in the North. I wrote my reference letter myself, and in the letter stated how Bauchi is volatile, and getting the letter there will be life threatening. Apologies to folks in Bauchi reading this…I am in Lagos, so that’s the best I could come up with. I had a picture I took with one of the projects completed with other World Bank officials, I added it. Then went to GT( Allowie acc) and asked for statement of account from opening for the 1 year, then my discharge certificate.. 2. Worked here for 2 years, in Lagos. Unfortunately, they are no more in Nigeria, so I attached all the evidence I had that I worked there. I had the hard copies of pay slips, emails between clients and I, My offer letter, my wedding leave letter, my resignation letter, my acceptance of resignation letter etc. Then also stated that they can find my boss on Linked in if they want. 3. Current job as at then. No biggie, I typed this myself again in the CIC format but with some swag. Then gave to my boss, he printed it on the letter head paper and stamped on it. That was all. Just that reference letter. No payslips, No statement of account. Just that one letter.<br><b>PPC/Medical</b>: I called immediately ITA landed to booked, I was sad when CP told me 27th September as the closest date. I tried the other one (not IOM) said 8th of October; that how I fell back to CP. Meanwhile, I wasn’t working full time, so I had most of the time. My Husband had taken leave for Sep 17th – 21st 2018. Had to wait till then. Called the weekend before, and ASP Moshood said we should come around 12 on Monday.  So we were there around 1pm, met the man, did it in like 30mins, paid 10k…And that was crossed from the list. So we decided to go to CP as we were in the area, the Nurse gave us 28th Sept, and that I shouldn’t be on my period, I checked my Calendar, It was a clear day. Hmmm, so we said ok, and walked out. Then I rushed back in and explained to the Nurse/receptionist, that we just have this week together, if there is any sot we can take. She asked us to come early tomorrow by 7 and wait, just in case some folks don’t show up. So we arrived around 8:30am, and sha waited. Meanwhile, I had to see a Client by 11am in Lekki, I was just confused. I didn’t believe when I got up and begged the lady again, that \i have to come out briefly and return. She was really nice, got back around 1. And was able to do the tests. We knew the whole things needed, so it was a breeze. …..By 4, we were out of there. And Yes! I got the contract from that Client. (My Application fees settled).In between; you won’t believe that my period actually started on the 28th of Sep. I thank God for redirecting us to insist on another day.<br><b>Passport Photographs</b><br>I used one at Bode Thomas, My friend referred me, she already has her PPR, and I needed somewhere I could trust. So we took our passports, and paid for both soft and hard copies,N3,000. That’s not the normal price o..But we got lucky. Will be using the Hard copies during the submission.<br><br><b>POF</b><br>Didn’t know anything about gift deed prior to our submission. We had a gift cash transfer in July and August in my Husband’s account. The intention was to use his account, so I was added as a signatory to his account. Printed the bank statement up till September 30, and waited for ITA. By the time ITA came, we had spent out of it, and checked the difference between treasury bills and money market. We decided to invest in money market. A friend of mine works in Mansard, and without even visiting the branch, my account was set after sending the requirements. I did a test run with N50k, interest was good. Then transferred 4m from Husband account. We needed 4.5m, so had to wait till month end for salary. The money market account was opened Oct 2nd or so. So we attached the statement of funds + transfer teller showing the transfer from Husband’s account. That was all. So far, each month, the 4.5m yields 50k and liquidation is same day…so awesome. We always retain that 4.5m minimum to avoid stories.<br>I am a filing person, so organising the docs was not a problem. We scanned all with our phones using camscanner. The instructions are just easy, just read and follow.  We attached an LOE to explain my reference letters, and new account with Mansard. Was ready since Oct 2nd, but submitted Oct 5th after a lot of trials trying to pay for the application. I bought the black market price, someone used her $CAD card to pay. <br><b>POST AOR</b><br>The wait was okay. Just had distractions, so I didn’t feel it. Shebi they said within 6 months, So I paryed for 2 months…Instead it was my friend that got it DEC 5, was a win to me, felt like I still got it.<br>Then I was on my own hustle, then a job came to me. So currently working since Jan 9. Less time for nairaland and stuffs. <br>In February, with my rent due, I decided to use my Ralph card and send an email asking where my visa office is and to know the stage. I got an automatic response after 5 days. Resent it again, got another automatic response after 3 days. Sad, I decided to wait till March 5. March 5, nothing…Haba.Decided to use the web form to inquire about my visa office. In the message, I also mentioned my rent issues, that I need to plan accordingly, that please I need a response. Then I had to log in last Saturday when a lady said she felt a ghost update, I just saw my profile read 27 days more. I was just considering to raise a CSE even though I know its not required; that I have a new job, maybe that will remove whatever dust that want to grow on my file. Ada mentioned something like that, so it can’t hurt trying.<br>All Glory to God, who has been faithful to us…. <br>Every Case is Different.

"<div class=""narrow"">Congratulations to you, go and prosper in cannyland <blockquote><a href=""/post/76575769""><b>raphrulz</b></a>:<br><span style=""color:#000099;"">Guysssss!!!!<br><br><br><b>THE EAGLE HAS LANDED!!!!!<br><br><br>ISSA GOLDEN MAIL THINGS!!!<br><br>Here is my “brief story”… read at your own risk:</b><br><br>I have always believed that someday I would relocate fully out of Nigeria… whether it was for studies or something.. I just knew that my place was not this Naija. This was some years back.<br>Well, in 2011… when I was writing my ICAN, I had made friends with a couple of colleagues (also writing) the exam with me. One of them gave me some hints that he really wanted to leave Naija soon.. but never told me how. I also never bothered to ask. <br>I lost his contact, but got it back in 2014, only for me to see the kind of “abroad” pictures he was posting. I was like, “hope you are enjoying your vacation ooo” and he was like… “ Nooo.. this is not a vacation! I live here”<br>O boy!! That was how my ear/antennae just stood up ooo… I started interrogating him like an FBI agent… I asked him about the immigration process and how he went about it. He simply just sent me a link to read up on…. And that was the end. I was demotivated even before reading it properly. That was how I gave up on the idea.<br>In 2016, I stumbled on Australian immigration information and followed it gracefully. I gathered all the necessary information I needed and saved on my system. Good thing is that, I have never been that person to embark on a journey without thoroughly researching and asking myself very tough questions. I was so ready to embark on it… but did not have the funds. Well, the issue was not even the funds per se, but the fact that when I informed my parents about it, they totally kicked against it. Their argument was that, Aussie was too far and it would make me forget Naija. My relatives also added to this perspective, with examples of my distant cousins that had gone to Aussie many years ago but had not returned. I was completely discouraged and let this phase slide again.<br>After the above incidences, I had now decided to face my “Nigerian fate”… and so focused solely on my work and all. <br>In December 2017, while going home with one of the staff of my clients, she kept asking me about my career, what I intended to do in the medium to the long term etc. I kept downloading my plans passionately to her. I kept emphasizing on the professional exams I was set out to do, how I looked forward to growing through the career ladder in Nigeria and so on…. If only I had known that all those plans discouraged her from telling me about the Canada immigration EE process, I probably would have kept quiet. She told me later after I had commenced the process, that she wanted to tell me about the EE process, but seeing how passionate I was about the “Nigerian Plans” made her hold that key information back.<br>Well, fast forward to April 2018, while working at the office, I overheard one of my close friends/colleague telling another colleague about the EE immigration process and how he had gotten his Visa and bought his ticket ahead of his exit in August 2018. Immediately I heard that, I interjected, then asked him to brief me on the full information. Funny enough, the person he was telling was acting uninterested back then despite informing him about the process since far back 2017.<br>Well, as a sharp guy who had been looking for such an opportunity, I asked him what it would entail… and he gave me a brief highlight based on his knowledge about it. I was not satisfied with what he told me, so went ahead to research on it myself. That was when I stumbled on this thread and decided to feed on it like it was breakfast and Lunch. I dwelt there for days reading from the past information and PPR stories (days of Dupyshoo and Zandora etc). Then I knew I had to commence immediately.<br>However, I remember clearly that when my friend told me about the associated financial commitment for a single applicant, my heart sank… as I wondered how I would have been able to finalize my POF. But God came through for me.<br>I registered immediately for my IELTS in April to be written in May… and immediately sent my B.Sc and ACCA transcript (membership certificate) to Wes for evaluation.<br><br><b>IELTS</b><br>First IELTS was written in May: Lost out in Listening as I had 7.5 (BC)<br>Second IETLS was written on 7 July: LSRW – 8.5, 8.5, 7, 7 (BC)<br>Prior to the first IELTS, I had practiced a bit, but was slightly over confident because I felt that it was just a simple test of English which shouldn’t have been a problem at all for me. I however practiced the maps for a whole day using YouTube, and became a master in it as I was not failing any questions on maps anymore. Unfortunately, maps did not come out in the first exam.<br>When the result came out that morning, I was not happy with myself, but I told myself that I would channel all that efforts to scheduling for another exam.  I was reading negative comments all over the place, on groups and so on… especially people that did not pass the exams like me… but I shut out those thoughts to avoid being discouraged.<br>Immediately the next day came, I quickly scheduled for another, raised the draft of N75,000 and paid to BC. I thought that this would motivate me to read ooo… but boy!! My work wouldn’t allow me. There was absolutely no time at all. The night before the exam, I just skimmed through some lines and slept off… went for the exam the next day… and the rest, they say, is history!<br><br><b>Educational Credential Assessment</b><br>I used the conventional WES for my ECA… and it was a smooth ride. Luckily for me, they were not requesting for WAEC then. <br>So I reached out to my school to send my transcript (which took just between 14 – 21 working days) and to ACCA which took 14 working days. Also, note that I commenced the ECA transcript transmission alongside my preparation for IELTS. I also sent my B.Sc. and ACCA membership certificates to WES via Hellofax.<br>My WES report came out on 19 June 2018 with a summary of “2 or more degrees”. This was a complete breeze. In fact, I didn’t have to reach out to them for any information or complaints.<br><br><b>ITA</b><br> As at 20th July, 2018… I had my IELTS result and ECA ready… but did not dive into the pool because of my funds were not completely in the state I wanted it. I had to wait for some more funds before diving. I had a score of 468, so I was certain that I would get ITA once I dived. So I made up my mind to patiently wait till I was ready. <br>I had timed September 5 as my chosen ITA date… so I entered the pool on September 1. I got ITA and was so excited. It felt so surreal. Immediately, I swung to action and started to follow up with all necessary documentation.<br><br><b>Post ITA</b><br>i.  <b>PCC</b><br>This was a breeze. In fact, I had gotten a contact from my friend that told me about the EE process, I called the person a day before I went there. I took a one-hour break during my lunch time at work, went to their office asking of the Police officer I spoke to a day earlier. That was when I realized the guy had retired. However, the person he told me to ask of, happened to be his successor. The finger prints were taken, all the necessary things were done, price was negotiated to my desired 5k, then I picked up my completed PCC and headed back to work. I was happy!<br>I scanned the pink copy along with the finger printed copy and merged both together using my Adobe Acrobat. I attached the document to the PCC place holder<br><br>ii. <b>Passport photograph</b><br>This was snapped a day before I did the PCC at LUTH. I also got the contact from my friend. I ensured to take both soft and hard copy of the pictures before leaving the place. I ensured that the pictures were well measured in my presence in line with CIC requirements. The guy was experienced on CIC requirements, so it was hassle free exercise. The price was also very reasonable.<br>I attached the soft copy version to the placeholder in my EE profile.<br><br>iii. <b>Educational Certificates</b><br>As usual, I merged my University B.Sc Certificate with my ACCA membership certificate, ECA report and IELTS report using Adobe Acrobat. I attached the merged documents to the relevant placeholder in my App. I used Nigeria as the ACCA location, as this was where I wrote the exam.<br><br>iv. <b>International Passport and travel documents</b><br>This was also scanned and attached to the relevant placeholder.<br><br>V. <b>Medical Assessment</b><br>This was where I faced my second challenge through the EE process. I attempted to go through the normal route like everyone. Called IOM, Children’s Practice and Q-life to book… Lo and behold, the prices of IOM and Children’s practices were ridiculously high, so I took them completely off my list. Unfortunately, Qlife that was fairly priced, was booked till about October 20 something. I knew that I couldn’t wait till then, so I had to device a quick alternative. Then the idea of gate crashing came to my mind.<br>The next day, I left my house very early, arrived there before 7 am and wrote my name down. I thought it was that automatic. Well, after such a long wait till about 8:30, the tests commenced. However, before they commenced, they separated those that had booked from those that had not, just like me… I was disheartened. They told us to go to the reception to book our test dates. Upon arriving there, the receptionist recognized my name and tried to confirm why I had come earlier than the supposedly booked date of 20 something. I immediately pleaded with her, and told her that I had received ITA, and need to do it urgently as it was time bound. She empathized with me and decided to reschedule me for the next day.<br>I was so excited and did not worry about the lost time for the day. I came to the hospital the next day (19 September 2018) for the test. All was completed and results were fine.<br>I just scanned the up-front medical slip and attached to the relevant placeholder in my application.<br><br>vi. <b>Proof of Funds (POF)</b><br>This was gathered overtime but ready long before my ITA. My complete POF was ready by August as I had to sell my car to make up the outstanding balance. It was so saddening as I began to trek and my mobility reduced drastically. Infact when I was to sell the car, I had my fair share of challenges.<br>The car dealer I gave to sell the car on my behalf suddenly claimed that one of the most important vehicle documents was missing, the Customs document. I was so shattered. How on earth could this get missing? Did I forget it when I went to make photocopies? Or was the dealer trying to play a smart one on me?? Those were few of the numerous thoughts I had. Unfortunately, I didn’t have a single copy of the document and potential buyers were not in any way willing to risk purchasing the car without these document, despite its clean physical outlook. At the end of the day I had to part with some substantial sum of money to get another one from Customs.<br>Well, I sold it, added it to the funds I previously had and placed all in a Fixed Deposit (FD) investment split into 70% (due in 6 months) and 30% due in 1 year. I ensured that the bank clearly stated that “the funds could be retrieved at will”… and the fact that only a percentage of the interest would be affected and not the principal sum that was booked.<br>I scanned the FD certificate, merged it with a screenshot of foreign exchange for CAD to Naira on October 4, a certificate of non-indebtedness and my 25% pension (for the purpose of fluctuations in exchange). I merged these documents and attached in the relevant placeholder.<br><br>vii. <b>Reference Letter</b><br>This was another slightly shaky area. I actually thought that it would be a walk in the park, but how wrong I was. I obtained a reference letter from one of my past places of employment where I had spent 3 years, but felt the need to go the extra mile to obtain same from my current place of employment. This was because I felt they might have still asked. Getting the 3 year reference letter in CIC format from my past place of employment was not difficult at all. However, getting reference letter from my current place of employment where I had spent almost 2 years was now challenging. <br>Now, considering that I had not really stayed long in this place, I was skeptical about letting them know about my immigration plans, so I sent a mail to our HR to prepare the letter in CIC format. But they refused and insisted I obtained the necessary approval from my unit head, which would mean me letting the cat out of the bag so soon. My unit head was out of the country, so I had to wait till my unit head arrived before obtaining the approval. We had a deep concerted discussion where I explained that I had considered immigrating because of my long term plans. Approval was eventually granted and the required reference letter n CIC format was provided. However, this made me delay my submission to October 4.<br>I merged my 2 reference letters only and attached to the relevant placeholders. I did not attach pay slips because the reference letters alone were completely aligned to CIC format.<br><br><b>AOR &amp; Post AOR</b><br>I eventually submitted my application on October 4 at 11:55 pm. I paid for the application fee but not the RPRF as I did not have the funds as at then. 28 days after, I got the Medicals Passed (MEP) notification and biometrics request. I went immediately the next day to do my biometrics.<br>The wait then started. <br>On December 3, I then decided to pay my RPRF unsolicited. No RPRF mail was sent to me, I just went to CIC website, paid and attached the downloaded receipt to a CSE (alongside my now rolled over FD certificate) and sent to them. <br>I was determined to wait it out, all the way, at least till 4 months before knowing my visa office, but the pressure around me wouldn’t let me be. So, I sent a follow-up CSE reminder to confirm if the RPRF receipts and FD roll over certificates had been transmitted to my visa office. I also included my request to know my Visa office in the same mail. The response came a day after, where I was informed that it was Ottawa. I was so excited.<br>The wait continued….<br>On 6th January I ordered my GCMS notes as I had not seen a single ghost update (Casper) unlike others. It arrived on 1st week of February, and I realized when I read through it, that only criminality was passed. Eligibility and Security had not started. I was so downcast by this recent development, but friends around cheered me up. <br>I kept the hopes alive but kept getting even more emotionally drained as the days faded by and as my CIC time bar crawled closer to the deadline day. What even added to this mental stress was seeing new applications in November and December getting PPRs before me. Wow! Lots of thoughts started to flood through my head. Did I do something wrong?? Did I offend anybody?? What was the problem actually??<br>Every time I opened my CIC account, there was no single update in my account whatsoever. Casper (the ghost) was indeed not friendly to me. I became a ghost hunter and praying every day for ghosts in my account. All to no avail. I was distraught and discouraged from even opening my account as I just felt it would be the same thing, however, I would say a silent prayer, for God to bring my turn closer.<br>Days went by, and it became less than 30 days to go. I felt it was due time for me to order my second GCMS notes. I mentioned it in the WhatsApp group I was on, and people encouraged me to go ahead. Some people also encouraged me to follow it through with a call, which I sluggishly accepted. I ordered the notes on 6th March… then attempted calling CIC on 7th March, but it did not go through. I temporarily gave up. On 8th March, I just felt the motivation to call again, with very little expectation. My waiting time was about 5 mins. When the voice at the other end rang, it made me shudder slightly. Well I downloaded all my details to her in response to her questions and followed it through with a question about the status of my profile.<br>Lo and behold!, She told me that my file was just approved on the 7th (the day before). I thought I didn’t hear her clearly… Lol.   I had to ask her if she was sure about what she said and she reiterated her statement, with more audacity. My hand immediately started shaking, then I thanked her and went off the line. I still took the information I got from the call with a pinch of salt, because I was yet to see any ghost update like other people would usually get before PPR.<br>Well, I just decided to check my profile after the call… Lo and behold! My first ghost update since I submitted my application. I was so excited.<br>And today, PPR!<br>Glory be to God!!!!<br><br><b><i>In a nutshell, my timelines are below:<br>7 July, 2018 - IELTS – LSRW (8.5, 8.5, 7,7)<br>19 June, 2018 – ECA report arrived (2 or more degrees)<br>5 September, 2018 – ITA<br>4 October 2018 – AOR<br>8 March 2019 – Ghost Update (Casper, the friendly ghost)<br>12 March 2019 – PPR<br><br>Single Applicant</i></b><br><br>… and it has finally ended in praise!!!

I was so shattered. How on earth could this get missing? Did I forget it when I went to make photocopies? Or was the dealer trying to play a smart one on me?? Those were few of the numerous thoughts I had. Unfortunately, I didn’t have a single copy of the document and potential buyers were not in any way willing to risk purchasing the car without these document, despite its clean physical outlook. At the end of the day I had to part with some substantial sum of money to get another one from Customs.<br>Well, I sold it, added it to the funds I previously had and placed all in a Fixed Deposit (FD) investment split into 70% (due in 6 months) and 30% due in 1 year. I ensured that the bank clearly stated that “the funds could be retrieved at will”… and the fact that only a percentage of the interest would be affected and not the principal sum that was booked.<br>I scanned the FD certificate, merged it with a screenshot of foreign exchange for CAD to Naira on October 4, a certificate of non-indebtedness and my 25% pension (for the purpose of fluctuations in exchange). I merged these documents and attached in the relevant placeholder.<br><br>vii. <b>Reference Letter</b><br>This was another slightly shaky area. I actually thought that it would be a walk in the park, but how wrong I was. I obtained a reference letter from one of my past places of employment where I had spent 3 years, but felt the need to go the extra mile to obtain same from my current place of employment. This was because I felt they might have still asked. Getting the 3 year reference letter in CIC format from my past place of employment was not difficult at all. However, getting reference letter from my current place of employment where I had spent almost 2 years was now challenging. <br>Now, considering that I had not really stayed long in this place, I was skeptical about letting them know about my immigration plans, so I sent a mail to our HR to prepare the letter in CIC format. But they refused and insisted I obtained the necessary approval from my unit head, which would mean me letting the cat out of the bag so soon. My unit head was out of the country, so I had to wait till my unit head arrived before obtaining the approval. We had a deep concerted discussion where I explained that I had considered immigrating because of my long term plans. Approval was eventually granted and the required reference letter n CIC format was provided. However, this made me delay my submission to October 4.<br>I merged my 2 reference letters only and attached to the relevant placeholders. I did not attach pay slips because the reference letters alone were completely aligned to CIC format.<br><br><b>AOR &amp; Post AOR</b><br>I eventually submitted my application on October 4 at 11:55 pm. I paid for the application fee but not the RPRF as I did not have the funds as at then. 28 days after, I got the Medicals Passed (MEP) notification and biometrics request. I went immediately the next day to do my biometrics.<br>The wait then started. <br>On December 3, I then decided to pay my RPRF unsolicited. No RPRF mail was sent to me, I just went to CIC website, paid and attached the downloaded receipt to a CSE (alongside my now rolled over FD certificate) and sent to them. <br>I was determined to wait it out, all the way, at least till 4 months before knowing my visa office, but the pressure around me wouldn’t let me be. So, I sent a follow-up CSE reminder to confirm if the RPRF receipts and FD roll over certificates had been transmitted to my visa office. I also included my request to know my Visa office in the same mail. The response came a day after, where I was informed that it was Ottawa. I was so excited.<br>The wait continued….<br>On 6th January I ordered my GCMS notes as I had not seen a single ghost update (Casper) unlike others. It arrived on 1st week of February, and I realized when I read through it, that only criminality was passed. Eligibility and Security had not started. I was so downcast by this recent development, but friends around cheered me up. <br>I kept the hopes alive but kept getting even more emotionally drained as the days faded by and as my CIC time bar crawled closer to the deadline day. What even added to this mental stress was seeing new applications in November and December getting PPRs before me. Wow! Lots of thoughts started to flood through my head. Did I do something wrong?? Did I offend anybody?? What was the problem actually??<br>Every time I opened my CIC account, there was no single update in my account whatsoever. Casper (the ghost) was indeed not friendly to me. I became a ghost hunter and praying every day for ghosts in my account. All to no avail. I was distraught and discouraged from even opening my account as I just felt it would be the same thing, however, I would say a silent prayer, for God to bring my turn closer.<br>Days went by, and it became less than 30 days to go. I felt it was due time for me to order my second GCMS notes. I mentioned it in the WhatsApp group I was on, and people encouraged me to go ahead. Some people also encouraged me to follow it through with a call, which I sluggishly accepted. I ordered the notes on 6th March… then attempted calling CIC on 7th March, but it did not go through. I temporarily gave up. On 8th March, I just felt the motivation to call again, with very little expectation. My waiting time was about 5 mins. When the voice at the other end rang, it made me shudder slightly. Well I downloaded all my details to her in response to her questions and followed it through with a question about the status of my profile.<br>Lo and behold!, She told me that my file was just approved on the 7th (the day before). I thought I didn’t hear her clearly… Lol.   I had to ask her if she was sure about what she said and she reiterated her statement, with more audacity. My hand immediately started shaking, then I thanked her and went off the line. I still took the information I got from the call with a pinch of salt, because I was yet to see any ghost update like other people would usually get before PPR.<br>Well, I just decided to check my profile after the call… Lo and behold! My first ghost update since I submitted my application. I was so excited.<br>And today, PPR!<br>Glory be to God!!!!<br><br><b><i>In a nutshell, my timelines are below:<br>7 July, 2018 - IELTS – LSRW (8.5, 8.5, 7,7)<br>19 June, 2018 – ECA report arrived (2 or more degrees)<br>5 September, 2018 – ITA<br>4 October 2018 – AOR<br>8 March 2019 – Ghost Update (Casper, the friendly ghost)<br>12 March 2019 – PPR<br><br>Single Applicant</i></b><br><br>… and it has finally ended in praise!!!

So, my last night was like chaos for me. Got home 10:45pm from the office as I was preparing documents that will be needed for the trip till 9:15pm. Meanwhile, as I got home….entered the Kitchen immediately, my other job. Had to fix a soup for my Husband to eat in my 4 days absence. By the time I was done, it was past 12. My darling Husband looked at me, and said….He cannot imagine I still had all the strength to arrange all this…….bla bla….long story short, We slept late, like past 2, cos after dinner/bfast we watched TV to allow the food digest. While preparing and stuffs; We just discussed how we were going to call the Lawyer in charge of our house and pay up our rent. We had waited for a notice since January, as rent was due Feb 14th, but no word. So we decided to call. My Husband had called him yesterday, but for some reasons, it was moved till today. We had just concluded to pay a year’s rent just incase he doesn’t agree to 6 months and if the PPR comes later than expected. Meanwhile, our visa expires in September, So we are planning till July/August to leave. It has all been a ball of confusion while waiting for the golden mail. So now, obviously, whether the Lawyer likes it or not….We are paying him the 6 months !!!! That’s the first testimony! <br><br>PRE CANADA<br>My neighbour told me about express entry way back in 2016! He said, that I am lucky, that his own application wa paper based and has been more than a year. He sent me the link ….I studied all through the pages. Then, I wasn’t married, I had finished my masters and currently working. That was when I had the Canadian dream. If you caught me day dreaming, I was somewhere in Vancouver, or Toronto…In fact I created a note book which I called “my Canada book”. I took notes and dreamed big. I had calculated the cost of living as well as my salary as an Intern Architect. It was quite impressive, and kept my dream alive. Somewhere during my research, I had read, one has to be married for at least one year to claim married. That’s how I suspended it, as I was preparing to get married in September that year. <br>So, fast forward to 2017 February, I had started a 14 months course that distracted me. In between,after the 1 year , It came up again, My Husband has been sceptical about the whole migration thingy. I cant remember what happened that month, but he began to reconsider. I brought out my “Canada book” Did a fresh research, things had change, IELTS was no more 52k, Was now’ 68k. I tabled the whole cost of processing it and all. The sum was enormous…Till I mentioned the Proof of Funds…..Then it was officially suspended again. The conclusion was that we can apply to visit once in a while, Lets make it here; Nigeria has a big avenue for progress and growth.<br>April 2018, Course ended…What project was next? Canada<img src=""/faces/huh.png"" style=""width:15px;height:22px;""> Yay!!!! <br>So I assured my Husband, that it’s the best thing to do. He had a friend that had relocated since 2011, his friend also encouraged him to come. …That’s how We began our journey.<br>PRE ITA<br>ECA: Registered with WES, my friend that had left since 2016, was a darling. I told her that we have finally decided to begin. And I was having issues paying WES with my debit card. That was how she asked my for my sign in details, and made the payments for me…Just like that! I started wondering how someone can be so carefree, deep down, I was even scared to send her the money to do it for me, to avoid stories that touch But she suggested to do it anyways…I paid to her Naija account 65k. <br>Then I knew I needed just the master. Went to Unilag, I was told I could do it online, that was cool. Since I had just come already, I gave one lady at Eco bank the application to process. Cost was 19500. 1k for her data….That one pained me o. Then I went to EPS behind Ecobank to courier my photocopy of Certificate. I was given 2 prices..N1500 (5 weeks), N16000 (5 days). I thought it through; then went for the N1500. In like a moth, my Certificate was received, but transcript still pending. That how I started going to Unilag to push them to send my transcript. I was always busy, so couldn’t be a regular. Then it was received, then verification came ….as August drew near, I started panicking and pushing my cousin to disturb them to verify. Anyways, God came through as usual.. I got a notification that it will be redy by 4th of September. I started my profile ahead and waited for the ITA.<br>IELTS: In all honesty, I never really practiced. I had the notion that, it was just English, how difficult can it be? I had studied about the sections, what goes on where, how to talk, what to listen to….Most of the times, I read in the car, on my way to work, sample letters, examples of speaking topics, what to say etc. My Speaking Test was topic was “CONCENTRATION” . It wasn’t funny at all. I stammered, and was confused why I will have a topic like that. Common…Who asks anyone “What’s the effect of concentration on people in the City?” After the Test, I started hinting my Husband that it wasn’t as I had expected it o. First, I was shocked to see an elderly black man as my Test giver. The man looked li a Ghanaian, and I know Naija and Ghana beef. I just prayed it was going to be okay. A day to the other exam, the only day I had to practice; I quickly went to deliver an errand at my In-law’s place….that how I watched two movies (that I have watched before o) Got home around past 9, and went to bed. Woke up early, and glanced through my phone again for points and ideas. Centre was at Oregun, See crowd!! I was dumbfounded. As I only knew myself, I just faced my front, and was attentive throughout. Though the test was delayed for two hours, that part wasn’t funny. Results came out to the Glory of God, 8,7,7,7! I had not come across this thread yet, and also never knew the way IELTS can humble someone, I can only assume that If I had known that IELTS is a fail able test; I would have failed out of panic. It was much later that my friend told me that I was lucky, that she wrote it 5 times, the last she had to go to Abeokuta as Lagos wasn’t working for her. I thank God it went well. Immediately, I knew my score, as I had calculated with it. CRS 442. <br>I apologize for those offended with my exceeding thanks to God, but in all things I give thanks to God.<br>My Birthday is September 16th. I had calculated the forecast of ITAs to September 5. And was waiting for my ECA to drop since July 2018. With my Husband’s ECA, it was 452. So I registered his. By then, Unilag has increased the transcript to 25k, and the postal to N2500. I didn’t know about Hello fax by then. And up till now, Unilag cannot trace my Husband’s result. So, my chances was to hope ECA drops before 5th, if not the next ITA will be 19th (Husband’s birthday) and I would have lost 5 points down to 437. Then 440s was the real deal. I just turned to God and prayed. I have created a profile and submitted without the ECA , it made the profile ineligible. I had to create another, then waited. As God will have it, ECA dropped September 4, as promised….I dived into the pool @ 442!!!<br><br>POST ITA<br>This is where I found nairaland. My friend had sent me a link, I cant remember what for, But I found myself on a page with so much information, I saved it on my phone home screen. That as how I knew what to do when I get to Children’s Practice, gor ASP Moshood number, Knew places for passport photo, saw samples of reference letter. I started following up from when Mepconsultant got his PPR and people were arguing or so. Anyways, What annoys me while I read on to even this part is how basic questions that google can answer is being asked here. I got all the information form Page 1 of Part 5. Its appalling that one will claim to be a “graduate” who did “thesis” or “project” and also have above 3.5m, but cannot, I mean cannot research on a life changing journey; ;like as if One is being forced to go to Canada. …Lemme not deviate.<br>Reference Letters:<br>I claimed 3 jobs. 1. Nysc in the North. I wrote my reference letter myself, and in the letter stated how Bauchi is volatile, and getting the letter there will be life threatening. Apologies to folks in Bauchi reading this…I am in Lagos, so that’s the best I could come up with. I had a picture I took with one of the projects completed with other World Bank officials, I added it. Then went to GT( Allowie acc) and asked for statement of account from opening for the 1 year, then my discharge certificate.. 2. Worked here for 2 years, in Lagos. Unfortunately, they are no more in Nigeria, so I attached all the evidence I had that I worked there. I had the hard copies of pay slips, emails between clients and I, My offer letter, my wedding leave letter, my resignation letter, my acceptance of resignation letter etc. Then also stated that they can find my boss on Linked in if they want. 3. Current job as at then. No biggie, I typed this myself again in the CIC format but with some swag. Then gave to my boss, he printed it on the letter head paper and stamped on it. That was all. Just that reference letter. No payslips, No statement of account. Just that one letter.<br>PPC/Medical: I called immediately ITA landed to booked, I was sad when CP told me 27th September as the closest date. I tried the other one (not IOM) said 8th of October; that how I fell back to CP. Meanwhile, I wasn’t working full time, so I had most of the time. My Husband had taken leave for Sep 17th – 21st 2018. Had to wait till then. Called the weekend before, and ASP Moshood said we should come around 12 on Monday.  So we were there around 1pm, met the man, did it in like 30mins, paid 10k…And that was crossed from the list. So we decided to go to CP as we were in the area, the Nurse gave us 28th Sept, and that I shouldn’t be on my period, I checked my Calendar, It was a clear day. Hmmm, so we said ok, and walked out. Then I rushed back in and explained to the Nurse/receptionist, that we just have this week together, if there is any sot we can take. She asked us to come early tomorrow by 7 and wait, just in case some folks don’t show up. So we arrived around 8:30am, and sha waited. Meanwhile, I had to see a Client by 11am in Lekki, I was just confused. I didn’t believe when I got up and begged the lady again, that \i have to come out briefly and return. She was really nice, got back around 1. And was able to do the tests. We knew the whole things needed, so it was a breeze. …..By 4, we were out of there. And Yes! I got the contract from that Client. (My Application fees settled).In between; you won’t believe that my period actually started on the 28th of Sep. I thank God for redirecting us to insist on another day.<br>Passport Photographs<br>I used one at Bode Thomas, My friend referred me, she already has her PPR, and I needed somewhere I could trust. So we took our passports, and paid for both soft and hard copies,N3,000. That’s not the normal price o..But we got lucky. Will be using the Hard copies during the submission.<br>POF<br>Didn’t know anything about gift deed prior to our submission. We had a gift cash transfer in July and August in my Husband’s account. The intention was to use his account, so I was added as a signatory to his account. Printed the bank statement up till September 30, and waited for ITA. By the time ITA came, we had spent out of it, and checked the difference between treasury bills and money market. We decided to invest in money market. A friend of mine works in Mansard, and without even visiting the branch, my account was set after sending the requirements. I did a test run with N50k, interest was good. Then transferred 4m from Husband account. We needed 4.5m, so had to wait till month end for salary. The money market account was opened Oct 2nd or so. So we attached the statement of funds + transfer teller showing the transfer from Husband’s account. That was all. So far, each month, the 4.5m yields 50k and liquidation is same day…so awesome. We always retain that 4.5m minimum to avoid stories.<br>I am a filing person, so organising the docs was not a problem. We scanned all with our phones using camscanner. The instructions are just easy, just read and follow.  We attached an LOE to explain my reference letters, and new account with Mansard. Was ready since Oct 2nd, but submitted Oct 5th after a lot of trials trying to pay for the application. I bought the black market price, someone used her $CAD card to pay. <br>POST AOR<br>The wait was okay. Just had distractions, so I didn’t feel it. Shebi they said within 6 months, So I paryed for 2 months…Instead it was my friend that got it DEC 5, was a win to me, felt like I still got it.<br>Then I was on my own hustle, then a job came to me. So currently working since Jan 9. Less time for nairaland and stuffs. <br>In February, with my rent due, I decided to use my Ralph card and send an email asking where my visa office is and to know the stage. I got an automatic response after 5 days. Resent it again, got another automatic response after 3 days. Sad, I decided to wait till March 5. March 5, nothing…Haba.Decided to use the web form to inquire about my visa office. In the message, I also mentioned my rent issues, that I need to plan accordingly, that please I need a response. Then I had to log in last Saturday when a lady said she felt a ghost update, I just saw my profile read 27 days more. I was just considering to raise a CSE even though I know its not required; that I have a new job, maybe that will remove whatever dust that want to grow on my file. Ada mentioned something like that, so it can’t hurt trying.<br>All Glory to God, who has been faithful to us…. <br>Every Case is Different. Do the right thing and avoid shortcuts.<br>See you in Canada before the Winter!!!!<br><br><br><br>Congratulations � dear. We will join you soon.</div>",3:04pm,Mar-12,2019

So my question is if i get a diploma from NOUN, will it count as two or more certificate for ICES, <br>Does the diploma have to be related to be my bsc for it to count or just any diploma, i was at NOUN yesterday and the lady suggested diploma in peace studies and conflict resolution.<br>Any suggestion would be appreciated as admission is currently going on.<br>Secondly  if i do get this diploma from NOUN, do i have to repeat my ECA to be able to get points for two or more certificate? <br>Lastly, from my eatimated present crs score, will pnp be a better chance for me compared to the diploma,. <br><br>I know these questions may have been addressed one way or another, i just need to be sure i am on d right part.  Pls help a confused girl..</blockquote>Yes diploma from NOUN counts as two or more certificates. No it diehard to be related to your initial course of study. Yes you'll need to upgrade your ECA report but it's easier as you're not starting from scratch. No, PNP is not a better option. The diploma is better.<br>Wish you the best</div>",3:26pm,Mar-12,2019

I can tell you from the experience that it won’t have any negative impact on your application.however, your application might be subjected to more checks hence longer processing time. Also,You’ll need to explain yourself and be honest about your past immigration history cos everything will be exhumed during ur background checks. you can visit USA when u become a Canadian citizen.<br>I repeat don’t hide anything, Goodluck and sin no more.</div>",12:17am,Mar-15,2019

I just knew that my place was not this Naija. This was some years back.<br>Well, in 2011… when I was writing my ICAN, I had made friends with a couple of colleagues (also writing) the exam with me. One of them gave me some hints that he really wanted to leave Naija soon.. but never told me how. I also never bothered to ask. <br>I lost his contact, but got it back in 2014, only for me to see the kind of “abroad” pictures he was posting. I was like, “hope you are enjoying your vacation ooo” and he was like… “ Nooo.. this is not a vacation! I live here”<br>O boy!! That was how my ear/antennae just stood up ooo… I started interrogating him like an FBI agent… I asked him about the immigration process and how he went about it. He simply just sent me a link to read up on…. And that was the end. I was demotivated even before reading it properly. That was how I gave up on the idea.<br>In 2016, I stumbled on Australian immigration information and followed it gracefully. I gathered all the necessary information I needed and saved on my system. Good thing is that, I have never been that person to embark on a journey without thoroughly researching and asking myself very tough questions. I was so ready to embark on it… but did not have the funds. Well, the issue was not even the funds per se, but the fact that when I informed my parents about it, they totally kicked against it. Their argument was that, Aussie was too far and it would make me forget Naija. My relatives also added to this perspective, with examples of my distant cousins that had gone to Aussie many years ago but had not returned. I was completely discouraged and let this phase slide again.<br>After the above incidences, I had now decided to face my “Nigerian fate”… and so focused solely on my work and all. <br>In December 2017, while going home with one of the staff of my clients, she kept asking me about my career, what I intended to do in the medium to the long term etc. I kept downloading my plans passionately to her. I kept emphasizing on the professional exams I was set out to do, how I looked forward to growing through the career ladder in Nigeria and so on…. If only I had known that all those plans discouraged her from telling me about the Canada immigration EE process, I probably would have kept quiet. She told me later after I had commenced the process, that she wanted to tell me about the EE process, but seeing how passionate I was about the “Nigerian Plans” made her hold that key information back.<br>Well, fast forward to April 2018, while working at the office, I overheard one of my close friends/colleague telling another colleague about the EE immigration process and how he had gotten his Visa and bought his ticket ahead of his exit in August 2018. Immediately I heard that, I interjected, then asked him to brief me on the full information. Funny enough, the person he was telling was acting uninterested back then despite informing him about the process since far back 2017.<br>Well, as a sharp guy who had been looking for such an opportunity, I asked him what it would entail… and he gave me a brief highlight based on his knowledge about it. I was not satisfied with what he told me, so went ahead to research on it myself. That was when I stumbled on this thread and decided to feed on it like it was breakfast and Lunch. I dwelt there for days reading from the past information and PPR stories (days of Dupyshoo and Zandora etc). Then I knew I had to commence immediately.<br>However, I remember clearly that when my friend told me about the associated financial commitment for a single applicant, my heart sank… as I wondered how I would have been able to finalize my POF. But God came through for me.<br>I registered immediately for my IELTS in April to be written in May… and immediately sent my B.Sc and ACCA transcript (membership certificate) to Wes for evaluation.<br><br><b>IELTS</b><br>First IELTS was written in May: Lost out in Listening as I had 7.5 (BC)<br>Second IETLS was written on 7 July: LSRW – 8.5, 8.5, 7, 7 (BC)<br>Prior to the first IELTS, I had practiced a bit, but was slightly over confident because I felt that it was just a simple test of English which shouldn’t have been a problem at all for me. I however practiced the maps for a whole day using YouTube, and became a master in it as I was not failing any questions on maps anymore. Unfortunately, maps did not come out in the first exam.<br>When the result came out that morning, I was not happy with myself, but I told myself that I would channel all that efforts to scheduling for another exam.  I was reading negative comments all over the place, on groups and so on… especially people that did not pass the exams like me… but I shut out those thoughts to avoid being discouraged.<br>Immediately the next day came, I quickly scheduled for another, raised the draft of N75,000 and paid to BC. I thought that this would motivate me to read ooo… but boy!! My work wouldn’t allow me. There was absolutely no time at all. The night before the exam, I just skimmed through some lines and slept off… went for the exam the next day… and the rest, they say, is history!<br><br><b>Educational Credential Assessment</b><br>I used the conventional WES for my ECA… and it was a smooth ride. Luckily for me, they were not requesting for WAEC then. <br>So I reached out to my school to send my transcript (which took just between 14 – 21 working days) and to ACCA which took 14 working days. Also, note that I commenced the ECA transcript transmission alongside my preparation for IELTS. I also sent my B.Sc. and ACCA membership certificates to WES via Hellofax.<br>My WES report came out on 19 June 2018 with a summary of “2 or more degrees”. This was a complete breeze. In fact, I didn’t have to reach out to them for any information or complaints.<br><br><b>ITA</b><br> As at 20th July, 2018… I had my IELTS result and ECA ready… but did not dive into the pool because of my funds were not completely in the state I wanted it. I had to wait for some more funds before diving. I had a score of 468, so I was certain that I would get ITA once I dived. So I made up my mind to patiently wait till I was ready. <br>I had timed September 5 as my chosen ITA date… so I entered the pool on September 1. I got ITA and was so excited. It felt so surreal. Immediately, I swung to action and started to follow up with all necessary documentation.<br><br><b>Post ITA</b><br>i.  <b>PCC</b><br>This was a breeze. In fact, I had gotten a contact from my friend that told me about the EE process, I called the person a day before I went there. I took a one-hour break during my lunch time at work, went to their office asking of the Police officer I spoke to a day earlier. That was when I realized the guy had retired. However, the person he told me to ask of, happened to be his successor. The finger prints were taken, all the necessary things were done, price was negotiated to my desired 5k, then I picked up my completed PCC and headed back to work. I was happy!<br>I scanned the pink copy along with the finger printed copy and merged both together using my Adobe Acrobat. I attached the document to the PCC place holder<br><br>ii. <b>Passport photograph</b><br>This was snapped a day before I did the PCC at LUTH. I also got the contact from my friend. I ensured to take both soft and hard copy of the pictures before leaving the place. I ensured that the pictures were well measured in my presence in line with CIC requirements. The guy was experienced on CIC requirements, so it was hassle free exercise. The price was also very reasonable.<br>I attached the soft copy version to the placeholder in my EE profile.<br><br>iii. <b>Educational Certificates</b><br>As usual, I merged my University B.Sc Certificate with my ACCA membership certificate, ECA report and IELTS report using Adobe Acrobat. I attached the merged documents to the relevant placeholder in my App. I used Nigeria as the ACCA location, as this was where I wrote the exam.<br><br>iv. <b>International Passport and travel documents</b><br>This was also scanned and attached to the relevant placeholder.<br><br>V. <b>Medical Assessment</b><br>This was where I faced my second challenge through the EE process. I attempted to go through the normal route like everyone. Called IOM, Children’s Practice and Q-life to book… Lo and behold, the prices of IOM and Children’s practices were ridiculously high, so I took them completely off my list. Unfortunately, Qlife that was fairly priced, was booked till about October 20 something. I knew that I couldn’t wait till then, so I had to device a quick alternative. Then the idea of gate crashing came to my mind.<br>The next day, I left my house very early, arrived there before 7 am and wrote my name down. I thought it was that automatic. Well, after such a long wait till about 8:30, the tests commenced. However, before they commenced, they separated those that had booked from those that had not, just like me… I was disheartened. They told us to go to the reception to book our test dates. Upon arriving there, the receptionist recognized my name and tried to confirm why I had come earlier than the supposedly booked date of 20 something. I immediately pleaded with her, and told her that I had received ITA, and need to do it urgently as it was time bound. She empathized with me and decided to reschedule me for the next day.<br>I was so excited and did not worry about the lost time for the day. I came to the hospital the next day (19 September 2018) for the test. All was completed and results were fine.<br>I just scanned the up-front medical slip and attached to the relevant placeholder in my application.<br><br>vi. <b>Proof of Funds (POF)</b><br>This was gathered overtime but ready long before my ITA. My complete POF was ready by August as I had to sell my car to make up the outstanding balance. It was so saddening as I began to trek and my mobility reduced drastically. Infact when I was to sell the car, I had my fair share of challenges.<br>The car dealer I gave to sell the car on my behalf suddenly claimed that one of the most important vehicle documents was missing, the Customs document. I was so shattered. How on earth could this get missing? Did I forget it when I went to make photocopies? Or was the dealer trying to play a smart one on me?? Those were few of the numerous thoughts I had. Unfortunately, I didn’t have a single copy of the document and potential buyers were not in any way willing to risk purchasing the car without these document, despite its clean physical outlook. At the end of the day I had to part with some substantial sum of money to get another one from Customs.<br>Well, I sold it, added it to the funds I previously had and placed all in a Fixed Deposit (FD) investment split into 70% (due in 6 months) and 30% due in 1 year. I ensured that the bank clearly stated that “the funds could be retrieved at will”… and the fact that only a percentage of the interest would be affected and not the principal sum that was booked.<br>I scanned the FD certificate, merged it with a screenshot of foreign exchange for CAD to Naira on October 4, a certificate of non-indebtedness and my 25% pension (for the purpose of fluctuations in exchange). I merged these documents and attached in the relevant placeholder.<br><br>vii. <b>Reference Letter</b><br>This was another slightly shaky area. I actually thought that it would be a walk in the park, but how wrong I was. I obtained a reference letter from one of my past places of employment where I had spent 3 years, but felt the need to go the extra mile to obtain same from my current place of employment. This was because I felt they might have still asked. Getting the 3 year reference letter in CIC format from my past place of employment was not difficult at all. However, getting reference letter from my current place of employment where I had spent almost 2 years was now challenging. <br>Now, considering that I had not really stayed long in this place, I was skeptical about letting them know about my immigration plans, so I sent a mail to our HR to prepare the letter in CIC format. But they refused and insisted I obtained the necessary approval from my unit head, which would mean me letting the cat out of the bag so soon. My unit head was out of the country, so I had to wait till my unit head arrived before obtaining the approval. We had a deep concerted discussion where I explained that I had considered immigrating because of my long term plans. Approval was eventually granted and the required reference letter n CIC format was provided. However, this made me delay my submission to October 4.<br>I merged my 2 reference letters only and attached to the relevant placeholders. I did not attach pay slips because the reference letters alone were completely aligned to CIC format.<br><br><b>AOR &amp; Post AOR</b><br>I eventually submitted my application on October 4 at 11:55 pm. I paid for the application fee but not the RPRF as I did not have the funds as at then. 28 days after, I got the Medicals Passed (MEP) notification and biometrics request. I went immediately the next day to do my biometrics.<br>The wait then started. <br>On December 3, I then decided to pay my RPRF unsolicited. No RPRF mail was sent to me, I just went to CIC website, paid and attached the downloaded receipt to a CSE (alongside my now rolled over FD certificate) and sent to them. <br>I was determined to wait it out, all the way, at least till 4 months before knowing my visa office, but the pressure around me wouldn’t let me be. So, I sent a follow-up CSE reminder to confirm if the RPRF receipts and FD roll over certificates had been transmitted to my visa office. I also included my request to know my Visa office in the same mail. The response came a day after, where I was informed that it was Ottawa. I was so excited.<br>The wait continued….<br>On 6th January I ordered my GCMS notes as I had not seen a single ghost update (Casper) unlike others. It arrived on 1st week of February, and I realized when I read through it, that only criminality was passed. Eligibility and Security had not started. I was so downcast by this recent development, but friends around cheered me up. <br>I kept the hopes alive but kept getting even more emotionally drained as the days faded by and as my CIC time bar crawled closer to the deadline day. What even added to this mental stress was seeing new applications in November and December getting PPRs before me. Wow! Lots of thoughts started to flood through my head. Did I do something wrong?? Did I offend anybody?? What was the problem actually??<br>Every time I opened my CIC account, there was no single update in my account whatsoever. Casper (the ghost) was indeed not friendly to me. I became a ghost hunter and praying every day for ghosts in my account. All to no avail. I was distraught and discouraged from even opening my account as I just felt it would be the same thing, however, I would say a silent prayer, for God to bring my turn closer.<br>Days went by, and it became less than 30 days to go. I felt it was due time for me to order my second GCMS notes. I mentioned it in the WhatsApp group I was on, and people encouraged me to go ahead. Some people also encouraged me to follow it through with a call, which I sluggishly accepted. I ordered the notes on 6th March… then attempted calling CIC on 7th March, but it did not go through. I temporarily gave up. On 8th March, I just felt the motivation to call again, with very little expectation. My waiting time was about 5 mins. When the voice at the other end rang, it made me shudder slightly. Well I downloaded all my details to her in response to her questions and followed it through with a question about the status of my profile.<br>Lo and behold!, She told me that my file was just approved on the 7th (the day before). I thought I didn’t hear her clearly… Lol.   I had to ask her if she was sure about what she said and she reiterated her statement, with more audacity. My hand immediately started shaking, then I thanked her and went off the line. I still took the information I got from the call with a pinch of salt, because I was yet to see any ghost update like other people would usually get before PPR.<br>Well, I just decided to check my profile after the call… Lo and behold! My first ghost update since I submitted my application. I was so excited.<br>And today, PPR!<br>Glory be to God!!!!<br><br><b><i>In a nutshell, my timelines are below:<br>7 July, 2018 - IELTS – LSRW (8.5, 8.5, 7,7)<br>19 June, 2018 – ECA report arrived (2 or more degrees)<br>5 September, 2018 – ITA<br>4 October 2018 – AOR<br>8 March 2019 – Ghost Update (Casper, the friendly ghost)<br>12 March 2019 – PPR<br><br>Single Applicant</i></b><br><br>… and it has finally ended in praise!!!

"<div class=""narrow"">God is too good<br><br>...Long post alert...<br><br><blockquote>Timeline<br>Decision to vamoose: 1st Jan 2018<br>IELTS: 21 Apr LRWS 8.5,9,7,8<br>ECA: 28 May<br>EE profile created: 28 May (CRS 478)<br>ITA: 13 June (cut-off 456)<br>AOR: 31 July<br>IP0: 2 Aug<br>MEP/BIL: 28 Aug<br>BIL completed: 29 Aug<br>IP1/Job mail: 12 Sept<br>IP2: Sometime between 26 Oct and 1 Nov<br>PPR: 15 March 2019<br>VO: Ottawa<br>No ADRs<br>Moderate travel history<br><br>Decision to Emigrate<br>The reasons for the decision to permanently move are as plenty as they are varied, and you all already know every single one of them. I got tired of whining about the failed systems and decided to do something about it.<br>So on New year's Day 2018, I woke up, examined my ceiling for 30 minutes, brainstormed really hard on how to make Nigeria great again and ended up with the resolution to pick race! <br><br>IELTS<br>My old passport was due to expire in 2018 so I decided to wait and start the process with a new passport. As soon as it was within the 6 months time-frame, I started the renewal process. In the meantime, I practiced IELTS listening tests like crazy.<br>I collected the new passport on a Tuesday and booked with MOD for the exam holding on the Saturday of that same week (BC had no dates available for the next two months). Thankfully I got good grades at the first try.<br>I practiced Listening and Reading on <a href=""https://ieltsonlinetests.com/"">https://ieltsonlinetests.com/</a> I've already written about this site before so no need rehashing it.<br>I did very minimal study/practice on the speaking and writing modules. During the exam, I just wrote/spoke as I would in everyday life, there was no special strategy or tip applied to my tests. <br>My speaking main task was to summarize the plot of an interesting book that I had read. Hei God!! Me that ayam the resident film/book narrator in my family!<br>By the time I finished telling my two minutes story (filled with suspense and drama), the examiner was like <img src=""https://www.nairaland.com/faces/shocked.gif"" alt=""shocked"" border=""0"" class=""faces""> hehehehe<br>As for the writing module, my job requires a lot of writing/editing/reporting, so I guess this was a case where work experience doubled as practice for the exam.<br>In all, I’m so thankful God that I didn’t have to rewrite IELTS. Its one aspect of this process where I have learnt to be grateful for small mercies.<br><br>ECA<br>I used WES for my ECA. This was in the good old days before they were possessed by the devil. <br>If I hadn't already made the decision to leave Nigeria, I would have come to that decision after comparing the experiences relating to the transcripts’ request from my schools.<br>My original plan was to evaluate only my Masters for the PR process, and then while waiting for PPR, go ahead to evaluate the BSc as a means of keeping my transcripts close, in case of further studies.<br>Now my MSc transcript - from a UK school - was a breeze to evaluate. Ordered the transcript from the school store, made the payment, emailed the WES transcript request form to the registry and called to confirm that everything was hunky-dory.<br>After a couple of weeks, WES had still not received the transcript so I called registry again. I discovered that they delayed in processing and sending the transcript to WES, the person I was speaking with at the time said they just dispatched it. I was so angry! I told them that that was very irresponsible and emphasized how disappointed I was at their lackadaisical pace. After I finished speaking all my queens english with native British accent, they apologised profusely and I lapped up all the ‘we apologize miss Ifeoma’ and ‘we are very sorry for the inconvenience’. I then resigned myself to fate and mentally increased my expected ECA completion date by at least one month. . <br>Two days later, I received an email from the school. Apparently, they took responsibility for the delay and they decided to send another set of transcripts via courier - at their own expense, I was so impressed even though the gesture turned out to be redundant. The first set of transcripts - sent with regular post - reached WES in exactly seven days. The same day I received the tracking information for the second set of transcript, was the day WES updated my account to ‘documents received’ (for the first set).<br><br>On the other hand, my Nigerian school? Chai!!!!!!!<br>Sometime after AOR, I went to my school to kick-start the ECA process and 'acquire’ a contact who'll help with verification. Everything was a hassle, everybody dodgy and grasping. There was no time for queen’s english and grammar in this one o, na correct pidgin pesin pikin kon dey blow. I was already seriously rethinking the necessity of the ECA when one Aunty called me aside to 'advise’ me.<br>There were like 3 women in the office and the ringleader started; “My dear, see ehn, This Canada thing ehn, o dikwa very hard. I know how people used to come here to cry because of this Canada transcript and verification wahala, Even that woman that just left here sef, did you see her? The one that tied red turban? iz all the way from Taraba state that she came for this thing o, and did she finish? Mba! O diro easy at all! But you, I just like you so I will help you…” she paused and looked round, the other women nodded rapidly like agama lizards “...I will help you fast track the transcript and handle the verification. Just drop money and goan sleep. I know how much I used to collect o, but because e bu nwannem, give me only 150,000 for everything”<br><br>Chineke!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>Did I mention that the sum total of what I paid the UK school = £7 (NGN 3480)?<br>One hundred and fifty thaaaasand naira!! Just like that?! <br><br>For a just-in-case ECA?<br><br>Inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji'un<br><br>I thanked her sha, collected her phone number and bank account details, cut my losses and walked out. She is still waiting for the alert, ayam coming... <br>The thunder being designed for her is a collaboration from Amadioha, Sango and Thor.<br><br>Post-ITA<br>I took my sweet time in getting my application ready.<br><br>-Medicals<br>I used IOM for medicals and I've already written a very long post on this before.<br><br>-POF<br>POF was pretty straightforward, I used 70% gift deed from Dad. I shouldn't really call it a gift-deed, it was more like gift letter <img src=""https://www.nairaland.com/faces/cheesy.png"" alt=""cheesy"" border=""0"" class=""faces""> He wrote a letter saying he is gifting the money to me and then attached the transfer receipt from his bank. I didn't notarize the letter, didn't get it stamped at the high court, didn't sign on it that I received the gift and didn't include any witnesses’ signature.<br>The cash in the account covered the POF and then some but I still added my RSA because why not? Izz my hard earned money <img src=""https://www.nairaland.com/faces/cheesy.png"" alt=""cheesy"" border=""0"" class=""faces""><br>The POF placeholder contained a summary table, letter from bank, account statement, letter from PFA, PFA account statement and Oanda conversion page.<br>I left the POF liquid in the account throughout the processing. I didn't fix it and didn't purchase TBills.<br>The bank letter was not IRCC format. Infact it's the most generic letter I've ever seen in my life. The letter literally has just four lines;<br>1. We're writing this recommendation on the request of our customer Ifeoma blablabla, account number blabla.<br>2. She has successfully run this account since blabla.<br>3. Afford her any assistance and blabla<br>4. For further enquiries, contact us through blabla.<br>I didn’t collect non-indebtedness’ letter because apparently, according to this bank’s policy, I can only get it from the branch where I opened the account.<br>I should also mention that the account statement I attached was for just one day - the day the gift entered. I added the account statement mainly to show the account balance since the knuckleheads at the bank vehemently refused to modify their boring reference letter.<br>It was as if all the bank workers were members of the village people association, but God pass them.<br>To be honest, I kinda expected to get ADR for updated POF, it didn’t happen. <br>It’s true what they say; no two applications are the same.<br><br>-Job Reference<br>Job reference was in CIC format. Signed by my Boss, not HR. I added my offer letter and payslips.<br>There was a point when I was getting confused over which NOC fits my JD best so I jejely carried myself to the therapy couch of the NOC Queen.<br>Thank you @Newmum0615 <br>you are a rare gem. <img src=""https://www.nairaland.com/faces/kiss.gif"" alt=""kiss"" border=""0"" class=""faces""><br>My JD was firm and locked in, no tweaking allowed. But I drafted the other parts of the letter, the hours and all that. I mailed it to my Boss for vetting and then to be printed on the official letterhead. My draft was two pages long. When I received the reference letter, my mouth dropped open in shock. Oga had increased it to seven pages! He wrote and wrote. Detailed descriptions of my duties, achievements, awards/promotions, character/personality/temperament, work ethic, supervisory/mentoring capabilities, weaknesses,  yada yada yada. If I had submitted that reference to Trudeau, I’d probably not have needed Express Entry <img src=""https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png"" alt=""grin"" border=""0"" class=""faces""><br>It was really sweet...and unnecessary. When I tried to explain, I received a long lecture about how old people can be seated and see what young people cant see even when they are standing &lt;insert eyeroll&gt; <img src=""https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png"" alt=""grin"" border=""0"" class=""faces""><br>I used my reference like that joor, let IRCC agents know that ayam awesome  <img src=""https://www.nairaland.com/faces/cool.png"" alt=""cool"" border=""0"" class=""faces""><br>PS.

When I saw the 'multiple required’ I interpreted it to mean that I'd need to add my expired passports. But then I remembered the case where one lazy VO rejected someone's application because he saw only the expired passport and not the valid one.<br>So instead of using the pdf merge I used for all other placeholders, I scanned my data pages and stamps/visas in JPEG. Then I pasted them on a word document - which was then saved as pdf before uploading.<br>The first page had the current valid passport. As a header, I wrote “VALID/CURRENT PASSPORT”, highlighted it, bolded it, underlined it, increased the font size to 80 <img src=""https://www.nairaland.com/faces/lipsrsealed.png"" alt=""lipsrsealed"" border=""0"" class=""faces""> <img src=""https://www.nairaland.com/faces/tongue.png"" alt=""tongue"" border=""0"" class=""faces""><br>Since there are no visas or stamps in the new passport, I left a full blank page before moving on the most recently expired passport. On the header of the page, I wrote “EXPIRED PASSPORT 1” coloured it red, bolded it, underlined it and used font size 60. The pages containing stamps and Visas followed and then Expired Passport 2 followed with its own visa and stamps.<br>Let me not hear that one blind VO did not see the valid passport in the document placeholder. Shioor<br>NB. This is unnecessary, just upload the current/valid passport and forget the expired ones. Simpler is always better. I did mine out of ignorance.<br><br>-eApr Photo<br>I stood against the white walls in my office, used my phone and took a selfie. Cropped it and uploaded. <br>Thanks to @Happytbaby for this tip<br>No need wasting money taking professional pictures for this stage, use your phone (or digital camera) and take the picture.<br>My plan is to take COPR pics with studio 24 as late as possible so it will still be within the 6 months mark by the time I land.<br>Now that PPR is here, I'm off to do that.<br><br>-Education<br>In addition to the ECA, IELTS TRF and MSc certificate, I added my (unaccessed) BSc certificate.<br><br>AOR<br>After reading Newmum's account of mixing up documents in placeholders despite checking and rechecking, I decided to use one full week for final checks.<br>So day 1, I'd sign in, check the documents in the first placeholder, cross-check it with my list, read every line, ensure its crystal clear and legible, nod my head with satisfaction and then sign out. Day 2, I'd do the same thing with the second placeholder and so on. Yes I know, I'm craycray <img src=""https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png"" alt=""grin"" border=""0"" class=""faces""><br>I spent a ridiculous amount of time researching and reading up all the advantages and disadvantages of paying RPRF upfront. How when they eventually ask for it, it helps you know that things are moving along on your application but how it might cause delays. I ultimately decided to pay it together with the application fee since I didn't want any rprf-related delay and I hoped my proactiveness will deliver my PPR out in a maximum of two months &lt;insert massive eye roll&gt; <img src=""https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png"" alt=""grin"" border=""0"" class=""faces""> <br><br>Post-AOR<br>I told myself that I won't order GCMS notes, won't worry myself about what was going on with my application. I know I put together a good application, everything was pretty straightforward, they can even send it to LVO,  after all, I had no intention of attempting a winter landing. I have time, I'm not under pressure, I won't be one of those freaking out and looking for patience to drink.<br><br>Story for the gods!!!!!!<br><br>I developed insomnia post AOR. I'd be lying in bed wondering what the VOs would think of this and what they'd think of that. What is happening with my application? Where is it now? Have they started this? Have they finished that? I signed into my account so often that IRCC probably considered blocking my IP address.<br>I wasn't joking when I said people should join a gym post-AOR. Exhaustion is a gift when your brain refuses to shut down at night.<br>The wait does not get easier o, issa lie. It is nerve-wracking from day one to the final day. Weekends will approach and you won't be happy because that's two days the VOs won't work. Canadian public holidays were pure torture.<br>The funny thing is that the agents seem to be witches, just when you're losing interest or you've found your zen and gotten to a place of acceptance, they'll give one update that will motivate you to start logging in again like crazy. From AOR to MEP, I logged into my account every. single. day. <br>After MEP, I saw that updates would definitely be communicated via mail, so I relaxed somewhat. Then I got the job mail and moved to IP1, that triggered another logging in frenzy. Let's not even talk of all the serious frantic research to determine that job mail is not the exclusive property of LVO. Yes o, at this point, I confessed to myself that I mind LVO and I don't want to be sent there. Few days later, I was able to get through the IRCC call center and confirmed that my application was in OVO, I danced around the house and screamed hallelujah <img src=""https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png"" alt=""grin"" border=""0"" class=""faces""> if only I knew what plans OVO had for me...<br>Anyway, knowing my VO made me relax somewhat again. And then silently, without mail notification, I moved to IP2. Another logging in madness started. This time, it was several times a day and the insomnia went from mild to severe. As the IP2 dragged on, I second-guessed everything I uploaded in my application, everyday, I made the decision to order GCMS and everyday I cancelled that decision (I read that post about third-party security breaches and identity theft and whatnot so I decided; better safe than sorry). <br>As the wait got longer and longer, I wondered whether I unknowingly committed any crimes in any of the countries I’d been to, I wondered if there's any Ifeoma somewhere who is a bride of ISIS, maybe the similar name is what is causing my long background check, I googled my name repeatedly to see if my village people have uploaded any damning information about me, I abandoned my MAP and could not focus on the pre-arrival courses.<br>You see that cup of patience? I searched for it like gulder ultimate search. <br>There's a theory on this thread that if you had it easy with IELTS/ECA, the universe gives you a long processing so you don't take the journey for granted. I still can't say I completely agree but I am definitely swayed. The funny part is that I didn’t have RR, Eligibility was met and Criminality passed by October 2018, since then...graveyard silence. As at 20 February 2019, Security was still not started.<br>I developed a new and massive respect for anyone who went through - or is going through - AVO/LVO/KVO, hailings guys! Your strength is not of this world.<br>See ehn long story made short, it doesn't matter how simple and linear your application is, you cannot just submit and go to sleep.<br>I'm considering ordering GCMS notes after landing. It would be interesting to see what went on during the processing.<br><br><br>PPR<br>After IP2, I developed the habit of reaching for my phone first thing in the morning. I'd just look for the Gmail icon. If it's not there, I'll drop the phone and get on with my day. If it's there, I'll close one eye, hold my breath and slowly, carefully swipe down to peep. I can't describe how heartbreaking it is to complete that swipe and see one nonsense mail not in anyway related to CPCO.<br>From the day I entered IP2, I stopped needing alarm to wake me up. Sometimes I wake up a full hour before my alarm goes off.<br>On Friday, 8 March 2019, I got a ghost update. I knew this could mean one of two things; either security had finally started or application has been approved. Either way, PPR was close.  <br>This morning, I woke up and saw the tiny Gmail icon at the top of my phone screen, I swiped down like I always do and finally, FINALLY, I saw IT, the golden mail! Sitting pretty and looking like what dreams are made of. I just held my phone with both hands and smiled the biggest smile of my life.<br><br>I'm still holding the phone... <br>I'm still smiling…<br><br>Every time I read a PPR story on this thread, I try to imagine how the recipient is feeling. Then I imagine how I'd feel when mine lands. It was always a toss up between screaming jumping excitement and speechless teary goosebumps.<br>My people o, PPR is here o and I can’t even describe how I feel right now, it's a cocktail of emotions, all of them intense, but predominantly; I feel blessed...so incredibly blessed… so overwhelmingly incredibly blessed!<br><br>To You, My e-Family<br>Thank you for keeping me sane(ish) during the wait. <img src=""https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png"" alt=""grin"" border=""0"" class=""faces""><img src=""https://www.nairaland.com/faces/grin.png"" alt=""grin"" border=""0"" class=""faces""> Thanks for the very many life/money-saving information shared on this thread.

This is great news. I have gained a lot from you since I started following this trend this week and reading through previous parts.</div>",9:39am,Mar-15,2019
"<div class=""narrow"">Hello e-family,<br><br>I have been going through the previous PARTS and also searching through them for answers. But I still have some questions that need further clarifications.<br><br>I need a second certificate and I am looking for the fastest route to get one because by next year I will be 30?<br><br>I was able to see that these various certificates were evaluated by WES CIMA, CIPM, ACCA, ICAN, CIIN, nacetem, NTI PGDE and NOUN PGD/MSC from the previous parts. <br><br>My question is considering the fact that NOUN won't be admitting new student until July which means if I enrol then I will have to wait till 2020 to graduate, do you know if WES can access just the certificate in CERTIFICATE IN INSURANCE from CIIN without undergoing the DIPLOMA IN INSURANCE<br> and ADVANCED DIPLOMA IN INSURANCE? Those who CIIN was accessed by WES said they got three years Canadian degree equivalent which made me think they probably evaluated the complete courses together.<br><br>Secondly, if am to consider going through the ACCA route, will I have to complete the whole courses before I can evaluate the certificates with WES or can I just take one paper or 1 module from the 4 modules then evaluate it as a second certificate to add with my BSc (since I don't really need it to be 3years equivalent). From the ACCA trend on NL I discovered that the ACCA syllabus consists of 14 papers divided into four modules - KNOWLEDGE 3 papers, SKILL 6 papers, ESSENTIALS 3 papers, PATHWAYS select 2 papers from 4 and it would cost about 600k to complete all excluding textbooks and lectures.<br><br>Furthermore, I discover that ACCA has a foundation in accounting route ( <a href=""https://www.accaglobal.com/africa/en/qualifications/glance/foundation-level/course-details.html"">https://www.accaglobal.com/africa/en/qualifications/glance/foundation-level/course-details.html</a>)<br><br>Foundations in Accountancy<br>Our foundation level qualifications comprise certificates and diplomas, as well as a technician level qualification. Exams and awards include:<br><br>ACCA Diploma in Financial and Management Accounting (RQF Level 2)<br><br>FA1       Recording Financial Transactions<br><br>MA1      Management Information<br><br><br>ACCA Diploma in Financial and Management Accounting (RQF Level 3)<br><br>FA2       Maintaining Financial Records<br><br>MA2      Managing Costs and Finance<br><br>ACCA Diploma in Accounting and Business (RQF Level 4)<br><br>FAB       Accountant in Business<br><br>FMA      Management Accounting<br><br>FFA       Financial Accounting<br><br>Q: Can I take one of this route to meet up with the second certificate to be evaluated by WES e.g ACCA Diploma in Financial and Management Accounting (RQF Level 2) only as this will take shorter time and will be less expensive.<br><br><br>Thank you.</div>",9:40am,Mar-15,2019

"<div class=""narrow"">Sorry about your remark and as for WES, you may need to call them. It takes them about 3-5 days to acknowledge verification, if they've not acknowledged it by now, it means they did not receive it and your school will have to send your verification again.<br><br><blockquote><a href=""/post/76683250""><b>jazzy</b></a>:<br>Congrats Ifeoma, <br><br>I was sooooo happy when i saw your announcement this morning..

Hoping to either write the computer based on the 2nd of April or the Paper on the 6th. Till then we match on. Another thing that is bothering is the slowness of WES. It is almost a month my school responded to the verification and i m yet to get past ""We received your document(s). We are reviewing your document(s)"". i m hopeful that by the time my IELTS result comes back on the 19th of April (if Paper), they should have been done. <br><br>Well done guys and enjoy the weekend.

"<div class=""narrow""><blockquote><a href=""/post/76683250""><b>jazzy</b></a>:<br>Congrats Ifeoma, <br><br>I was sooooo happy when i saw your announcement this morning.. May your journey to canny be smooth and easy and i pray that favor will always surround you. <br>In other news, i got my remark today... sadly scores remained unchanged LRSW- 8.5, 8.5, 8, 6.5. Hoping to either write the computer based on the 2nd of April or the Paper on the 6th. Till then we march on. Another thing that is bothering is the slowness of WES. It is almost a month my school responded to the verification and i m yet to get past ""We received your document(s). We are reviewing your document(s)"". i m hopeful that by the time my IELTS result comes back on the 19th of April (if Paper), they should have been done. <br>Well done guys and enjoy the weekend.

"<div class=""narrow"">Please I am in a Dilenma. I have 3 years work experience and I recently got an ITA.<br>However, I am seriously considering declining the ITA.<br>Firstly, I worked 1 year and 4 months at a startup company where I was paid by cash and I did NYSC at a Military establishment. Now my challenge is, I have no payslip or proof of payment from my employer that paid cash. In addition, the military establishment has refused to give me a reference letter, stating they don't give ex corpers reference letters since I wasn't employed by them, rather I served the country in their facility, even though they were paying me. Now I am left with just 10 months experience that can easily be proven. <br><br>Can I decline my ITA, wait till i complete one year in my current job, fill a new or edit my Express entry form using one year experience? Will this backfire in the future, especially as I filled three years already?<br><br>I am seriously considering this because when I goggled the name of the startup company online, i did not find any trace, they have no online presence at all and considering I don't have any proof that they paid me cash, it would be easy for anyone to doubt their existence; coupled with the challenge I am facing getting a reference letter from where I served.

I have 3 years work experience and I recently got an ITA.<br>However, I am seriously considering declining the ITA.<br>Firstly, I worked 1 year and 4 months at a startup company where I was paid by cash and I did NYSC at a Military establishment. Now my challenge is, I have no payslip or proof of payment from my employer that paid cash. In addition, the military establishment has refused to give me a reference letter, stating they don't give ex corpers reference letters since I wasn't employed by them, rather I served the country in their facility, even though they were paying me. Now I am left with just 10 months experience that can easily be proven. <br><br>Can I decline my ITA, wait till i complete one year in my current job, fill a new or edit my Express entry form using one year experience? Will this backfire in the future, especially as I filled three years already?<br><br>I am seriously considering this because when I goggled the name of the startup company online, i did not find any trace, they have no online presence at all and considering I don't have any proof that they paid me cash, it would be easy for anyone to doubt their existence; coupled with the challenge I am facing getting a reference letter from where I served. I think it's just too much drama.<br><br>Can the house please advise me, if this is the right decision.</blockquote><br>If the start-up is willing to write a ref letter for you, stating you were paid in cash, it shouldn't be a problem. You'll just attach whatever documents you have to prove you worked there, like your letter of appointment etc. I'm sure CIC will know how to conduct their own searches concerning the company. Besides if they're registered, there's a likelihood they'll be on the CAC public search portal. It's not a crime to be paid in cash, A number of people have gotten PPR with cash payments here<br><br>As for the military establishment, if you can get a reference letter from NYSC instead, stating you were posted there, you can also attach your posting letter, bank statements showing salary deposits from them  and write an LOE stating why you could not get a letter, I think you'll be fine <br><br>If you want to keep your application simple and stick to just one job that'll be easier to prove, then you'll have to decline this ITA and edit your profile. Hopefully your points don't drop lower than the draw scores at the time you'll be clocking one year at your current job<br><br>I don't know about the implications of editing your profile at this stage, but I read somewhere that at some point whatever changes you make will also be stored.</div>",10:54pm,Mar-15,2019

"<div class=""narrow"">For the start up company; 1yr 4 months experience is too much to throw away. Try and getting other supporting documents that can prove you worked there. For example; your offer letter, office emails( dates never lie) leave letters and pay slip summary highlighting the cash you paid in(that is if you paid the cash in yourself). <br>Then the NYSC is 1yr again....Easy. Write your JD and all. And explain that you worked for the military during your service year. Find attached supporting documents.....( pictures, emails, account balance highlighting ""allowie"" + ""PPA cash"", Nysc certificate...anything that links you there). I am certain during those times, pictures were uploaded on your social accounts. Trust me, by the time you choose to use just one year, your score might not get you an ITA. Be truthful and honest about everything and it will be fine<blockquote><a href=""/post/76692221""><b>Upton</b></a>:<br>Please I am in a Dilenma. I have 3 years work experience and I recently got an ITA.<br>However, I am seriously considering declining the ITA.<br>Firstly, I worked 1 year and 4 months at a startup company where I was paid by cash and I did NYSC at a Military establishment. Now my challenge is, I have no payslip or proof of payment from my employer that paid cash. In addition, the military establishment has refused to give me a reference letter, stating they don't give ex corpers reference letters since I wasn't employed by them, rather I served the country in their facility, even though they were paying me. Now I am left with just 10 months experience that can easily be proven. <br><br>Can I decline my ITA, wait till i complete one year in my current job, fill a new or edit my Express entry form using one year experience? Will this backfire in the future, especially as I filled three years already?<br><br>I am seriously considering this because when I goggled the name of the startup company online, i did not find any trace, they have no online presence at all and considering I don't have any proof that they paid me cash, it would be easy for anyone to doubt their existence; coupled with the challenge I am facing getting a reference letter from where I served.

Writing and speaking for 4years and even done my dissertation and défense en français what could be so hard about this English exam .. Plus I had written TOEFL before and aced it.. little did I know IELTS was listening to all my mind bragging..<br><br>First result LSWR. 9,8,6,7.5 I saw this result at about 12.57am and cried myself to sleep .. I requested for a remark and it was upgraded to 6.5. <br><br>I got another opportunity to write in October (because of my work schedule , it is sort of hard to get weekends off). This time I even bought ielts liz videos .. results LSWR .. 8.5,7.5,6.5,7.5<br><br>I asked for remark again but it came out negative ..<br><br>January I was ready.., this was a new year.. new grace and new everything . I decided to try a new environment . I was fasting for the new year and asking St Joseph to intercede .I decided to try something new MOD. Although the examiners are not as organised as BC i found the environment more suiting because the exam takers were fewer than what you would have in a BC venue. It was a school in lekki and it was such a peaceful environment ... Moreover I had used ielts advantage to prepare and I understood better what was expected of me .. for every essay structure I knew what every sentence should contain, however When i saw my results I was devastated .. <br><br>LSWR 8,7.5,7,6.5<br><br>I did not give up because I had my eyes on the prize and I knew the next one was definitely the last .. so I wrote again March 2nd ... ladies and gentlemen results are........<br><br>LSWR : 9,7,7.5,75<br><br>I was elated when I saw this ... my family and close friends called as if l had told them I had gotten the golden mail..<br><br>Moral of this is that we should never give up instead research and find it what works for you .. for me I used ieltsonlinetest to practice reading and listening and according to glittering star did not find the real exam so daunting  .. i never practiced speaking .. In fact I was expecting less because I almost missed this last speaking (story for another day) then for writing I practiced with the real answer script so during the main exams I could tell when I had reached 150 or 250 without even counting .. Plus i focused on knowing the structures of every way type and reading different sample types .. I could say I wrote just 3 essays while practicing ..<br><br>Thank you e fam...

"<div class=""narrow"">Congratulations! <blockquote><a href=""/post/76736526""><b>Natalie27</b></a>:<br>hello everyone , I just thought to drop this here to encourage anyone going through the IELTS hurdle.<br>I wrote the exam for the first time in July 2018,I was really confident about it <br>,*after all if i had studied french ? Writing and speaking for 4years and even done my dissertation and défense en français what could be so hard about this English exam .. Plus I had written TOEFL before and aced it.. little did I know IELTS was listening to all my mind bragging..<br><br>First result LSWR. 9,8,6,7.5 I saw this result at about 12.57am and cried myself to sleep .. I requested for a remark and it was upgraded to 6.5. <br><br>I got another opportunity to write in October (because of my work schedule , it is sort of hard to get weekends off). This time I even bought ielts liz videos .. results LSWR .. 8.5,7.5,6.5,7.5<br><br>I asked for remark again but it came out negative ..<br><br>January I was ready.., this was a new year.. new grace and new everything . I decided to try a new environment . I was fasting for the new year and asking St Joseph to intercede .I decided to try something new MOD. Although the examiners are not as organised as BC i found the environment more suiting because the exam takers were fewer than what you would have in a BC venue. It was a school in lekki and it was such a peaceful environment ... Moreover I had used ielts advantage to prepare and I understood better what was expected of me .. for every essay structure I knew what every sentence should contain, however When i saw my results I was devastated .. <br><br>LSWR 8,7.5,7,6.5<br><br>I did not give up because I had my eyes on the prize and I knew the next one was definitely the last .. so I wrote again March 2nd ... ladies and gentlemen results are........<br><br>LSWR : 9,7,7.5,75<br><br>I was elated when I saw this ... my family and close friends called as if l had told them I had gotten the golden mail..<br><br>Moral of this is that we should never give up instead research and find it what works for you .. for me I used ieltsonlinetest to practice reading and listening and according to glittering star did not find the real exam so daunting  .. i never practiced speaking .. In fact I was expecting less because I almost missed this last speaking (story for another day) then for writing I practiced with the real answer script so during the main exams I could tell when I had reached 150 or 250 without even counting .. Plus i focused on knowing the structures of every way type and reading different sample types .. I could say I wrote just 3 essays while practicing ..<br><br>Thank you e fam... I am a silent reader but you guys here are amazing .... May all our heart desires come through .</blockquote></div>",5:19pm,Mar-18,2019

"<div class=""narrow"">[quote author=jmnsimone post=76423114]Same thing happened to me - send them a strongly worded email asking why they're canceling an exam you already paid for. They'll reconfirm your date and k you a receipt. These people are still stuck in the 1980s and almost everything has to be manually confirmed.<br><br>I also had a similar issue bro. I have been calling them since last week and they kept promising to work on it. Glory to God this morning,I called them and a lady named Yemi picked the cal. I explained the same story that you shared here to her,then she asked me some questions regarding my registration,my reference number,the date I paid and the name of the account owner. She hanged me on for one minute then she came back and told me that she has worked on it,and in about thirty minutes I got my payment confirmation sms. I am due to receive my test venue in less than 24hours. So my advice to you bro is to keep calling them till they work on it for you.
